""Legacy"" Legislation to Honor McCain Proposed

Fresh off his crucial vote to kill the repeal of Obamacare, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) is now working with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to craft what McCain called ""a fitting legacy to honor my service to the country and Senate over my lifetime.""

The bill they are drafting is a revival of the so-called ""Gang of Eight"" measure passed by the Senate in 2013, but rejected by the House. It would give a path to citizenship to most illegal immigrants, greatly increase the number of visas to allow companies to replace American workers with foreigners and greatly increase the number of legal immigrants who would be eligible to enter the country over the next 30 years.

Schumer suggested that ""the new law might be dubbed 'McCainesty' as way to help people remember the man we are honoring with this crucial reform to our immigration policy. Considering the dire health of Sen. McCain, his good friend Sen. Graham (R-SC) has reluctantly agreed to surrender his long-held claimed right to name the policy change 'Grahamnesty.'""

McCain compared his proposal with the immigration bill recently unveiled by the Trump Administration, calling it ""a glaring contrast between a stance of selfishness and generosity. Trump wants to restrict immigration to protect already rich Americans from having to share our nation's wealth with those less fortunate. This is not the America I want to leave behind when I'm gone. I want an America that lives up to the Statue of Liberty's promise to house the homeless, wretched masses yearning to eat free.""

The Senator cited the $1.3 billion in welfare paid to illegal immigrants by Los Angeles County over the last two years as ""a down payment on our historic promise. Our new bill will remove barriers to an even greater fulfillment of the dream of a more equitable redistribution of the Earth's bounty and take us further toward President Obama's vision of a transformed world.""

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti endorsed the McCain-Schumer initiative as ""a demonstration of common sense. In theory, the redistribution could be accomplished by sending our wealth to other countries. It would be more practical, though, to let the beneficiaries come here. Not only will they spend a greater portion of the welfare in the local community, they'll also be present to cast the votes needed to elect those who will work to continue the transformation.""

Senators Want to Strengthen Independence of Special Counsel

Sens. Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Chris Coons (D-Del) are proposing legislation that would bar anyone from firing or in any way impeding Robert Mueller, the special counsel appointed to investigate President Trump and his associates for winning the 2016 presidential election.

""It is critical that special counsels have the independence and resources they need to lead investigations,"" Tillis said. ""Mueller can't be independent if he can be fired by anyone in the chain of command in the executive branch of government. He can't be independent if he must rely on congress for appropriations. He can't be independent if he must rely on a court or jury to validate his prosecutions.""

Jay Sekulow, one of President Trump's lawyers, blasted the proposed legislation as ""unconstitutional. Ours is a representative government. What Sen. Tillis and Coons are proposing is to create an omnipotent new office within the federal government. They would immunize Mueller from any executive oversight. They would enable him to dip into the treasury for any amount of money he deems necessary.""

Coons rallied to the defense of his senate colleague, pointing out that ""the premise that Trump represents the people is belied by the fact that he didn't win the popular vote. Every member of congress did win the popular vote in his state or district. It is our prerogative to transfer whatever powers we deem appropriate to whom ever we want. Much of the legislating that is now done in this country is by executive agencies that congress has empowered to make laws. In our view, setting a man with an untarnished record of integrity like Robert Mueller above and outside the normal processes that are suggested in the Constitution is a clear improvement over the governance we see incompetently emerging from the Trump Administration on a daily basis.""

Poll Results Addle Dem Leader

A poll conducted for Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif) by her ""House Majority PAC"" produced consternation and confusion for this top Democrat. For one, the poll found that the political ideologies of voters were 41% conservative, 32% moderate and 19% liberal, with 37% identifying as Independents, 35% as Republicans and 29% as Democrats. For two, among white working class voters 69% favored policies that reward hard work.

""These findings make no sense,"" Pelosi argued. ""Surely leisure is preferred over hard work. The Democratic Party has enacted measures that have expanded the opportunities for people to leave the workforce and still be able to live comfortably. There's public housing, food stamps, cell phonesall supplied gratis by laws and regulations we've championed. The liberal and Democratic cohorts among voters should be expanding, especially among the undocumented portion of the population.""

The Congresswoman speculated that ""perhaps the life of leisure we've provided has insidiously sapped the energy and initiative of those whose votes are crucial for our Party to continue to win elections. We think asking the beneficiaries to cast a vote is a small effort, but maybe once we've removed the effort required to support oneself from the equation even the minimal task of marking a ballot may seem too arduous.""

""Even worse, our new slogan--'a better deal: better jobs, better wages, better future'--seems to have backfired,"" Pelosi lamented. ""In the six months since Trump became president the economic data has been awful. There are more better-paying jobs and lower unemployment than anyone expected. Welfare rolls are shrinking. Fewer are living on food stamps. It's as if Trump's view is being vindicated.""

In related news, a recent poll conducted by the Pew Research Center found that 61% say the Democratic Party ""too often sees government as the only way to solve problems."" Unsurprisingly, this view was held by 83% of registered Republicans. Less expected was the finding that 44% of registered Democrats agreed. This perception of the Party as an advocate for statism is probably best encapsulated by Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy's statement that ""there is no anxiety, sadness, or fear that cannot be cured by political action.""

Felons Vying to Be Detroit's Mayor

Half of the eight candidates for mayor on Detroit's primary ballot have been previously convicted criminals. Donna Marie Pitts has multiple felony convictions dating back to 1977. Danetta Simpson has a 1996 felony conviction for assault with intent to murder. Articia Bomer was charged in 2008 with carrying a concealed weapon. In 2004, Curtis Christopher Greene was sentenced to 18 months' probation under the Holmes Youthful Trainee Act for dealing marijuana and in 2005 plead guilty to writing a fraudulent check.

Pitts called her conviction stemming from a shoot out at an auto repair shop ""an honest disagreement over the bill. Both sides were armed. Sending me to jail was bogus."" She says she is running to ""stamp out the kind of discrimination and racism that wrecked my life.""

Simpson got into a dispute with a woman who was living with the father of two of her four children, pulled out a gun and fired a shot that missed hitting the other woman. She contends that she was ""wrongfully convicted. No one was hurt. How is that an assault with intent? If I had intended to kill the bitch the bullet would've been in her head."" She says she is running to offer voters ""someone new and different.""

Bomer was charged in 2008 with carrying a concealed weapon. ""Overly suspicious"" police approached her while she was sitting in a parked car and found a loaded gun in the vehicle. Bomer denied that it was hers, but was convicted during a bench trial in January 2009 and sentenced to a year of probation. She says she is running on a platform of ""preservation, restoration and revitalization.""

Greene contends that ""my youthful indiscretions shouldn't be held against me. I have a seven point plan to rebuild Detroit. It addresses jobs, discriminatory lending and access to meaningful employment for convicted felons. I believe I'm the one to change the city.""

Whether any of the former felons will be able to win over the four other candidatesincumbent Mayor Mike Duggan, state Sen. Coleman A. Young II, Edward Dean and Angelo Brownthat do not have criminal records seems improbable. However, this election is the first since the City went bankrupt under the governance on non-felon Democrats over the last five decades.

In related news, Fayetteville, N.C. Mayoral candidate Quancidine Gribble has been arrested twice in the last two months for stealing and vandalizing a water company's equipment. Gribble, a philosophy student, community activist and charity leader, contends that ""water is a basic human need. No business has the right withhold it from the people. My action to liberate it from their control so it could flow freely to those who need it is simple social justice.""

Trump Threat an ""Impeachable Offense""

After the failure of the Senate to repeal Obamacare, a frustrated President Trump's threat to reverse President Obama's executive action exempting members of congress from having to live under the same regulations that apply to ordinary citizens forced into Obamacare brought howls of rage from Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT).

""We are members of government,"" Murphy fulminated. ""For Trump to vindictively throw us into the pit with the common people violates the unwritten rule against one segment of this elite group harming the privileges of another. It would renege on the bipartisanship exhibited by President Obama in even handedly extending the exemption to congressional Democrats and Republicans alike.""

""Trump may think he's immune from retaliation, but he should think again,"" the Senator advised. ""The House has the power to impeach and the Senate has the power to convict. The Constitutional grounds for impeachment are vague and unspecified. Let me remind Mr. Trump that Congress has the sole prerogative of determining what constitutes a satisfactory cause for his removal from office.""

2017-05-27,1495857393,"SEMI-NEWS/SEMI-SATIRE: May 28, 2017 Edition","Democrat Enraged Over Revived Interest in Rich Murder

Long-time Democratic Party operative John Podesta proclaimed former House Speaker Newt Ginrich's speculation that DNC staffer Seth Rich may have been assassinated ""disgusting.""

""After so much time has passed I think it's likely that we'll never know why this young man died,"" Podesta asserted. ""The DC police forgot to ask for surveillance tapes from all the CCTVs in the vicinity of the shooting. They forgot to seek witnesses at the bar Seth visited just before he died. They have his laptop, but since he didn't have it with him when he was shot I don't see how it could shed any light on the crime. There just aren't any more clues to be found.""

Gingrich contended that ""the absence of any evidence that Rich was robbed casts doubt over the hastily offered theory that the murder was part of a robbery gone wrong. Since that theory hasn't solved the case perhaps other theories of the crime should be considered. The emergence of a claim by Kim Dotcom that he worked with Rich to forward DNC emails to Wikileaks and that Rich might have been murdered in retaliation is a plausible alternative theory that, in my opinion, merits examination.""

An alternate theory that might explain Podesta's rage at the renewed interest in the fate of Seth Rich might be the revelation in one of his emails published by Wikileaks, where he wrote that he was ""definitely for making an example of a suspected leaker whether or not we have any real basis for it."" If, as Dotcom claims, Rich was the Wikileaks source, his murder could be ""an example"" aimed at discouraging other potentially disloyal Democrats.

European Leaders Say Islamic Attacks ""Not a Major Threat""

Murderous attacks by Islamic fanatics in the United Kingdom, Egypt, Indonesia, and the Philippines this week moved US President Donald Trump to make an impassioned plea for the civilized world to unite to fight against this terrorism. As obvious as such a call to action would appear to rational individuals, it inspired push back from several European leaders.

French President Emmanuel Macron challenged Trump's priorities saying that ""the murder of concert goers or nightclub patrons by 'lone wolf' terrorists does not pose the same existential threat that global climate change does. As heart breaking as the mass slaying of Ariana Grande's fans may have been, it doesn't rise to the level of a significant threat to our way of life. No important leader of any nation was endangered. Every important leader agrees that resources must not be diverted away from the more serious environmental issue of fighting global warming.""

German Chancellor Angela Merkel seconded Macron's views and added her own objections to Trump's suggestion that her country honor its NATO obligations. ""Mr. Trump's single-minded focus on military strength as the proper response to terror not only detracts from the unity necessary to combat climate change, it also overlooks the spending we have incurred in bringing Middle Easter refugees to Germany,"" she said. ""In the short-run some of these refugees have 'bitten the hand that feeds them,' but over the longer term the fecundity of these immigrants will ensure a more harmonious future for our country and the world.""

UK Prime Minister Theresa May observed that ""the irony of Mr. Trump's position is that it is the United States that poses the biggest threat to the rest of the world. Under his leadership, it is the United States that is out-of-step with the rest of us. His call for terrorists to be 'driven out of this earth' is culturally insensitive and burns the bridges we have been trying to build through our refugee rescue efforts. Trump's notion that we should fight to preserve 'Western values' is a false hope. Islam's march to world domination cannot be prevented. Their belief in their vision is so strong they are willing to die to make it happen. We cannot match their fervor. An accommodation is our only sensible option and Mr. Trump is the biggest single barrier to achieving it.""

Former US President Barack Obama traveled to Europe to express his solidarity with ""their more sophisticated understanding of reality. Europe isn't trying to wall itself off from immigration like Trump wants the United States to do. Walls send a hostile message telling others to 'stay out of my yard.' Good neighbors aren't so obsessively possessive. They don't fuss if the kids next door play in their yard. They cooperate to promote a safe and healthy environment like that sought by the Paris Accord on climate change. They cooperate to provide refuge for those fleeing war or poverty as Germany has so heroically done the last few years.""

Despite his denigration of Trump's pledge to protect America from unsavory outsiders, the ex-president's DC residence just completed construction of its own impressive wall around the property. Obama confidante Valerie Jarrett denied that there was any hypocrisy, saying that ""the wall is needed to protect against the violent society that Trump's election has brought to this country.""

In related news, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif) rebuked President Trump's foreign trip, alleging that ""visiting these places out of alphabetical order is a sign of mental disorder. Going to Saudi Arabia before going to Israel and France is, to me, unfathomable. No one in their right mind would do that. Clearly, our nation is being run by a person unfit for the office.""

Trump Wants Work Requirement for Food Stamps

A feature of Trump's proposed federal budget that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton labeled ""unimaginably cruel"" is a requirement that able-bodied persons receiving food stamps do a small amount of work in exchange for the benefit.

""Making people work in order to eat is slavery, pure and simple,"" Clinton declared. ""People shouldn't be punished for being poor and hungry. The choice of whether to work or not is one that should freely made without economic duress.""

Let's face it,"" she said, ""for most of those on food stamps the work alternatives available are dead-end drudgery. No one dreams of jobs like these and no one should be forced to give up their dreams just to put food on the table. America is rich enough to put food on everyone's table. It is the moral obligation of those who have more than they need to care for those who have less. It is the government's obligation to compel those who do not voluntarily fulfill this obligation.""

CBS Exposes Deadly Impact of ""Trump Economy""

The upsurge in economic activity that has followed from Donald Trump's elevation to the presidency has an unpublicized ""dark side"" according to a recent newscast from CBS.

Network correspondent Norah O'Donnell explained that ""what the Trump Administration failed to consider was that getting people off unemployment and welfare and into the workforce means more will be on the roads driving to their jobs. This exposes them to higher risk of death and injury in traffic crashes.""

""Worse, the risk isn't confined to the work commute,"" O'Donnell breathlessly told viewers. ""When people are more prosperous they also travel more for recreation. In fact, the National Safety Council predicts more than 400 people could be killed in crashes this Memorial Day Weekend. The concealment of this information by President Trump is a crime against humanity.""

""The safety gains the nation enjoyed under the Obama Administration as millions exited the work-a-day rat race are being cast aside by a mindless fixation on the notion that working is a good thing,"" O'Donnell observed. ""Facebook founder and acknowledged genius, Mark Zuckerberg pointed the way to a happier and safer future with his recommendation that the government ought to provide an income for everyone so they won't have to take on the risky task of working just to support themselves.""

Ironically, Zuckerberg disavowed such a strategy for his own employees ""because I'm trying to run a business. If I paid people regardless of whether they did any work, output would decline. Work is a disutility. That's why people have to be paid to do it. If we don't pay them they won't work or won't work as hard or as long. My business would fail.""

Zuckerberg insisted that ""the same rules don't apply to the government. For one, the government has the power to print money. It will never go out of business due to declining output. Second, the government doesn't have to sell its output in order to earn money. It can just take it through taxation. Finally, outside of transferring money from those who don't need it to those who do, it is not apparent that the government has any actual essential product or service to offer customers, per se. All the agitation for government programs is basically comprised of calls for someone else to foot the bill for the benefits being demanded.""

UN Says Trump Budget Inadequate

The Trump Administration's budget aims to reduce the United States' annual contribution toward funding the United Nations. Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, complained that ""the amounts laid out in the budget aren't sufficient for us to continue the vital work of the organization.""

Currently, there are 193 member nations in the UN. The US has been paying 22% of the UN's $5.4 billion ""core"" budget and 28% of the UN's $7.9 billion ""peacekeeping"" budget. Trump's budget proposal would cut the US contribution by one-third and cap the US share of ""peacekeeping"" at 25%.

Dujarric declared that ""the notion that the United States can unilaterally decide how much it will pay is offensive to me. For one, it's undemocratic. The US represents only 5% of the world population. Allowing a minority to overrule the 95% that wishes the US to pay more is tyranny. The US already has an unfair proportion of the world's total wealth. It has a moral obligation to share this with those less fortunate. Paying a larger portion of the UN's expenses would be a convenient start on a more equitable distribution of wealth.""

Obama Admin Spying ""Pervasive"" and ""Illegal""

Recently declassified documents reveal that the Obama Administration's spying on American citizens went far beyond what the law allowed. Under a pretext of surveilling foreigners, intelligence agencies under Obama gathered data on political opponents and illegally shared this information with outside parties.

Former FBI Director James Comey falsely assured Congress that ""this information was lawfully collected, carefully overseen and checked."" In contrast, an Inspector General's report found ""disregard for rules, inadequate training and deficient oversight."" The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA) found ""hundreds of violations of the FBI's rules"" that occurred during Comey's tenure as FBI Director.

Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY) told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that ""this is very troubling now that Trump is president. The absence of the calming guidance of former President Obama heightens the risk that snooping will be used for evil purposes. Violations that occurred in pursuit of a more socially just world under Obama could easily be turned toward maleficent ends under Trump.""

Blitzer concurred, opining that ""no one I know and trust had the least bit of concern when President Obama was in charge. Now, though, anxiety levels are the highest I have ever seen. Will Trump abuse this power to try to spy on progressives? Will he use illegally obtained information to try to intimidate his opposition? I think this may add a new sense of urgency to the movement to remove him from office before this can happen.""

2017-05-13,1494657048,"SEMI-NEWS/SEMI-SATIRE: May 14, 2017 Edition","Controversy Over Comey Dismissal

This week President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. Democrats who previously had called for Comey's departure denounced the move.

Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn), Vice Chairman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), contends that ""it has thrown the nation into a real constitutional crisis. Here we have a man who should never have been allowed to be president act as if he is the president. Since Hillary Clinton won the popular vote it seems to me that any changes in the personnel in the Executive Branch ought to be approved by her before they are made.""

Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif) agreed. ""When a person who should not be president usurps the authority of the office that is grounds for impeachment,"" she argued. ""Hillary Clinton should be the one to determine whether Comey deserved to be fired. Considering how he betrayed her during the campaign she would be justified in firing him. I could support that. The Trump Administration's complaint that Comey was doing a terrible job, over-stepping his authority, and impeding the investigation of leaks of classified information are illegitimate because they originate from an illegitimate president.""

Waters dismissed evidence that Comey sat on 600 million pages documenting the Obama Administration's massive illegal surveillance operation targeting American citizens as ""irrelevant. The fact is that if President Obama approved this surveillance its revelation by a whistle blower is treason, pure and simple. The FBI Director has no obligation not to impede an investigation that would impugn our last legitimate president's actions to protect this country from its domestic enemies.""

Following Comey's dismissal the New York Times published leaks from anonymous sources said to be Comey's ""associates at the Bureau."" The leaks reportedly gave details of a private, in-person, one-on-one conversation between Comey and President Trump. The leakers' allegation that Trump asked for Comey's loyalty is unverified. However, the very existence of this ""leak"" does seem to validate the premise that despite his denials that he has never leaked anything to the media nor authorized any of his subordinates to do so, Comey either is the source of this leak or that the leak is totally fabricated.

Michelle Obama Assails School Lunch Deregulation

Former First Lady Michelle Obama, the instigator of rules that led to massive trashing of school lunches across America, expressed her dismay at the Trump Administration's decision to allow local school authorities to select their own menus. ""What is wrong with these people?"" she wanted to know. ""The menus crafted under my guidance were carefully balanced for the right combinations of nutritious food.""

Trump Administration Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue defended the move, saying that ""requiring schools to set out food that students won't eat accomplishes nothing. Rather than force everyone to conform to a standard that leads to waste we are allowing local people who likely have a better idea of what their students will eat the latitude to make their own decisions.""

Michelle labeled Perdue's reasoning ""ignorant"" and ""a recipe for sickness and death. It shifts power from the recognized experts to local yahoos too weak to take on the task of altering the food prejudices of the masses. This 'laissez faire' attitude reverses the gains made during my husband's administration. And for what? Is the freedom to poison one's body with an unhealthful diet now some sort of inalienable right? I think most parents and voters will see it as a criminal attack on the health of our young people that clearly fits within the 'high crimes and misdemeanors' grounds for impeachment.""

Muslim Persecution in US Worse than ISIS Massacre of Christians

This week, ABC News political analyst Matthew Dowd challenged evangelist Franklin Graham's concerns about the persecution of Christians around the globe, calling it ""overblown. A far worse problem is the persecution of Muslims right here in the United States.""

While the practice of Christianity is illegal in some Muslim countries and severely hampered in others, Muslims in the US openly attend mosques and pray in public without any officially sanctioned interference and little unofficial notice or impediments. While Muslim fanatics readily heed the Quran's call to slaughter unbelievers who refuse to convert, there is no similar scriptural call for Christians to kill members of other faiths and Muslims are free to move about without being blown apart, shot, or beheaded by Christian zealots.

To Dowd, though, the absence of contemporary atrocities by Christians is ""historically myopic. Let's not forget that a thousand years ago popes called upon Christians to take back lands conquered by Muslims in that religion's great era of expansion. As former President Obama pointed out, plenty of Muslims died at the hands of pious Christians during these 'Crusades.'""

""The insidious signs of Muslim persecution in the US are evinced by the disapproving stares of Americans who disrespect their traditional garb, the extra scrutiny they get for merely repeating the words of their holy book, and the suspicion that their beliefs justifying jihad are dangerous and 'unAmerican,'"" Dowd maintained. ""Being forced to endure an atmosphere of continual dread is crueler than a quick thrust of a beheader's knife. So, yes, the horrors inflicted on Muslims in our country are worse than whatever has happened to Christians intruding on Muslim lands.""

Trump Gets Preferential Treatment in White House Dining Room

Appalling repression in the White House dining room came to light when the media exposed the scandalous story of how President Trump gets more and better food than other diners. In a Time magazine article it was revealed that at White House dinners Trump gets Diet Coke (everyone else gets water), Trump gets Thousand Island dressing (everyone else gets vinaigrette), Trump gets two scoops of ice cream (everyone else gets one).

CNN's Jeanne Moos saw this as ""unjustifiable discriminationthe kind that makes you wonder whether Trump thinks he's king."" In support of this theory, Moos cited the fact that ""Vice-President Pence doesn't get any ice cream. He's only allowed a 'fruit plate.' What has he done to get on Trump's bad side?""

Cristeta Comerford, the White House Executive Chef since 2005, denied there was any discrimination: ""anyone who asks is given the same option to choose as the President. You want something other than water? Just ask. You want a different salad dressing? We have many from which you can choose. You want two scoops of ice cream, three scoops, whatever? Just ask.""

Moos contended that ""the chef's response is too convenient to be credible. We need to know who pressured her to come up with this unbelievable alibi. Was she cowed into submission by the very public firing of the FBI Director? Or was her subservient status as a woman of color within a racist administration sufficient to extract the desired cover story? This incident would seem to bolster calls for an independent prosecutor to investigate Trump.""

Female Refugees Victims of Sexual Violence in Germany

A study by the news service Integrated Regional Information Networks (IRIN) found that female refugees living in government shelters are being repeatedly harassed and attacked by male guards and refugees. Sally Abazeed, a 20-year-old refugee from Syria, told of how she had been repeatedly accosted by a guard at the shelter. She also said she was often followed into the toilets at night by one of the guards.

Abazeed escaped from the shelter with the assistance of a fellow Syrian only to be raped by him once outside the compound. She reported the rape to the police, but was told she had insufficient evidence to justify an investigation.

Berlin Police Department spokesman Helmut Banger explained that ""our accommodation of sharia law requires that all rape allegations must be supported by either two male eyewitnesses or four female eyewitnesses. Unfortunately, Ms Abazeed could produce no witnesses. We had no alternative. We had to dismiss her case.""

More Abortions Needed to Fight Global Warming

Feminist icon Gloria Steinem made an impassioned plea for preserving and extending women's right to abortion, calling it ""a powerful and necessary remedy in the fight against sexual injustice and global warming. Nothing is worse for the planet than more people. Interdicting the creation of more people is crucial if we are to avert a holocaust.""

As Steinem sees it, men force women into bearing children. ""Considering the toll it takes on a woman's body, no woman in her right mind would willingly submit to childbirth,"" she contended. ""Add to this the tremendous sacrifice of free time that must be given up in order to care for children. Agreeing to have a child is akin to selling yourself into slavery. The men who pressure women into this tragic fate must be stopped.""

""Essential to stopping this pattern of patriarchal tyranny is abortion,"" Steinem asserted. ""A lot of people don't know this, but the Nazis paid women to have children. Thankfully, we haven't descended to that level of disrespect for humanity because we still allow abortion. As long as women have an unconstrained right to terminate any pregnancy they will hold the key that unlocks their chains. As an added bonus, the removal of millions and potentially billions of unwanted humans using this right is what will save the Earth from environmental catastrophe.""

Newspaper Calls for Stricter Censorship

Citing the ""need to protect the more sensitive among us from the psychological damage of words that could be construed as offensive,"" the editors of the Washington Post urged that ""we unwed ourselves from the notion that freedom of speech is a vital or even necessary feature of a civilized society.""

""The right of freedom of speech does not have a meaningful quantum of value to the average person,"" the editors wrote. ""The average person continually must refrain from saying things that would offend an employer, spouse, or friend in order to interact harmoniously with the people closest to him. Why shouldn't the government step in and enforce this same behavior as a general improvement of society?""

""There's an old saying 'that if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all.'"" the editorial continued. ""If everyone knew that insensitive utterances could result in substantial financial penalties or even jail time, it stands to reason that conversations would become more pleasant. Fewer feelings would be hurt. Fewer people would have cause to strike out at those who offend them. People would be happier.""

In related news, Edgewood Middle School in Trenton, Ohio gave seventh grader Zachary Bowlin a 10 day suspension for ""liking"" a photo of of an airsoft pellet gun on Instagram. Edgewood Schools Superintendent Russ Fussnecker explained that ""we have a 'zero tolerance' of inappropriate behavior by any of our students. The fact that Zachary publicly expressed his like for this dangerous weapon showed a grave insensitivity to his fellow students and manifested an intent to intimidate his classmates. The contention that the weapon is non-lethal, that the offense occurred outside of school grounds and hours does not excuse the behavior. We are going to stamp out incorrigible attitudes with as harsh a punishment as we can impose. Those who refuse to get the message will be crushed.""

2017-01-31,1485877107,End The Birthright Citizenship Loophole,"#WHO AGREES THAT WE SHOULD END BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP?

Its time to start the real heavy lifting.  At the time that the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified, the notion of birthright citizenship was centered around recently emancipated slaves.  However, in todays America, this loophole is being exploited by illegal immigrants.  

The United States is the ONLY industrialized nation that offers birthright citizenship (except Canada, which only shares a land border with the United States).  In Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, China, Japan and even Australia, children of immigrants are **not** automatically granted citizenship.  While a relatively small number of children are born to illegal immigrants, over time, the number of people in the United States as a result of this loophole will grow exponentially.  This policy continues to create a burden on our education system and other community resources.

The United States should adopt a reasonable policy regarding citizenship.

Situation | Result
:---|:---
Children of US Citizens^1 born in the US | Automatic US Citizenship
Children of US Citizens^1 born abroad | Automatic US Citizenship
Children of Resident Aliens^2 (Green Card) born in the US | Automatic US Citizenship
Children of Resident Aliens^2 (Green Card) born abroad | Automatic US Citizenship
Children of foreign nationals^3 born in the US | **No US standing**

^1 At least one parent is a US Citizen.

^2 At least one parent has a valid Resident Alien Green Card

^3 Includes student visas, and all other traveling foreigners, with valid or expired visas and including all illegal aliens.

The above table represents a reasonable update to current US Citizenship Policy.  It liberally permits for immigrants who are here legally to raise families with the all the promise and hope that living legally in the United States offers, knowing that their children born here, will enjoy all the fruits and responsibilities of full US Citizenship.  Alternatively, it will discourage illegal immigration for the express purpose of exploiting current US Immigration Policy.  This reasonable policy will also end the cottage industry of immigration travel, which is very popular from several Asian countries.  Regardless, the Fourteenth Amendment is in dire need of an update.
______________________________________________________
##Regarding *Anchor Babies* and ""*Dreamers*""

Minor children who are currently in the United States who are legal US Citizens (due to the aforementioned Fourteenth Amendment exploit), but whose parents are subject to deportation, should be deported along with their parents.  At such time said minor reaches the age of majority, they should be permitted to return to the United States uninhibited (as an adult).  These children should be grandfathered in regarding birthright citizenship, however, as minors, they should not be permitted to be wards of the state when their parents are (legally and appropriately) deported.  

Minors who are illegal aliens (undocumented) should be deported to their country of origin.

Should reasonable alternative arrangements be available, for example remaining in the United States with immediate family, this should be permitted liberally (provided said arrangement is not contingent on **any** form of public assistance; minor children of illegal aliens should not be permitted to receive food stamps or other similar benefit).  The idea isnt to punish these *Dreamers* or *Anchor Babies* for the illicit behavior of their parents, but to reasonably enforce US Immigration policy.

______________________________________________________

Many Americans are looking to the new US President to be a champion of reasonable immigration reform in conjunction with securing our borders.  Please consider that the intent of the Fourteenth Amendment is no longer germane to current immigration concerns and challenges.

Revelations that the Hillary Clinton-led US State Department granted favors to governments, corporations, and individuals that made donations to the Clinton Foundation have stirred concerns that a Clinton presidency might be tainted by corruption. Foundation president Donna Shalala urged that ""we take a more balanced look at the totality of the situation.""

""On the surface, the proximity of the donations and actions taken by Secretary Clinton does appear suspicious,"" Shalala admitted. ""However, Hillary has repeatedly said that all the actions she took would have been taken regardless of any donations that were made to the Foundation. Clearly donors weren't buying influence. At worst, they were merely moved up in the queue of those seeking favors from Secretary Clinton.""

""What is being overlooked is that extracting money from those seeking the State Department's approval for arms purchases, trade deals, and business permits helps boost the American economy,"" Shalala added. ""Over 90% of the money flowing into the Foundation is plowed back into the US economy in the form of salaries, rent, travel, accommodations and overhead. We employ 2,000 of the best and brightest people in this country to manage the activities of the Foundation. The money they spend stimulates economic growth. Less than 10% of the Foundation's resources flow out of the country as aid for needy foreigners. So, if we consider the big picture, the Foundation is an economic dynamo.""

""Given the economic benefits generated by the Foundation, we need to ask ourselves whether an inordinate squeamishness about how some transactions may have gone down should be permitted to undermine all the good that we have done,"" Shalala said. ""A better approach, in my opinion, would be to expand upon its success by electing Hillary Clinton president. Think about how much more she could do having the entire government under her control rather than just one department.""

Obama Administration Press Secretary Josh Earnest echoed Shalala's view, saying that ""there's a real danger that excessive scrutiny could kill the goose that's laying the golden eggs. A slavish devotion to propriety must not derail genuine progress toward a more socially just future. Tolerating a small amount of vigorish isn't too big a price to pay for ensuring that the right people wield the levers of power in government.""

More Clinton Email Questions

The latest 14,900 emails recovered by the FBI came from the 33,000 that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton deleted on the grounds that they were personal rather than work-related. Oddly, one of the topics discussed in many of them was Benghazi, which would seem to be ""work-related"" and as such legally required to be preserved and archived.

Hillary for President campaign manager Robbie Mook urged that ""we not jump to hasty conclusions. If you will recall, Secretary Clinton admitted she authored many emails dealing with planning her daughter's wedding. While we all know about the attack on Ambassador Stevens that occurred in Benghazi what a lot of people fail to recognize is that Benghazi could well have been a site under consideration for the wedding and/or honeymoon. Under such circumstances it should not be surprising that many of the Secretary's personal emails might include the word 'Benghazi' within the text.""

On top of this, more than a third of the emails involving Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin that were surrendered by the State Department in response to a Freedom of Information Act filing were 100% redacted. The content was deemed by the State Department as ""too sensitive for public disclosure."" Not even members of Congress are trusted to view the material. Ironically, one of the emails that wasn't redacted was a panicky message from Abedin regarding ""burn bag"" communications that she had left in an unlocked automobile. Burn bag communications are so secret that the reader is supposed to burn them after reading as a precaution against them falling into the wrong hands.

Clinton's treatment of her so-called ""personal"" emails showed a far higher level of precaution against them falling into the wrong hands. FBI forensic analysts found that Clinton's server showed evidence of having been cleaned by ""BleachBit""--a software program that goes far beyond mere deletion of unwanted files. Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) called the use of such software ""a greater length than any reasonable or honest person would go to conceal emails dealing with wedding plans or yoga routines as Secretary Clinton has insisted was her only intent.""

Long time Clinton aide Cheryl Mills took umbrage at Gowdy's remarks calling them ""sexist. Rep. Gowdy's belittling of wedding planning and yoga reveals an ugly subtext of misogyny lurking just beneath the surface. We think every female voter will understand the importance of keeping discussions of these topics away from prying eyes. Gowdy's gaffe will send another ten million women to the polls to vote for Hillary.""

In related news, a US Army training presentation includes slides with photographs of ""insider threats to national security."" One of those photographs is of Hillary Clinton. Maj. Thomas Campbell, a U.S. Army Training, and Doctrine Command spokesman, confirmed that the photo is genuine and said ""the possibility that one of these inside threats could be the next Commander-in-Chief is FUBAR.""

NY Times Reporter Slams Hannity for ""Unethical"" Behavior

New York Times reporter Jeremy Peters slammed radio talk show host Sean Hannity's ""unethical behavior"" regarding how he is covering the current presidential candidates.

""Every profession has its norms and boundaries for assessing the way its members should handle their trade,"" Peters proclaimed. ""Journalists have an ethical obligation to live up to these norms and respect these boundaries. It has been agreed by the majority within our profession that it is our journalistic duty to do whatever we can to prevent Donald Trump from becoming president. Hannity has flouted this agreement by urging voters to do the exact opposite of what every responsible journalist wants them to do.""

""Every minute of Hannity's show that fails to condemn Trump's candidacy is a lost opportunity to do the right thing,"" Peters insisted. ""Even worse, allowing Trump to speak and praising him for it constitutes millions of dollars in free advertising. This is unfair to Hillary Clinton who must traipse across the country to solicit the donations she needs to buy TV and radio ads to counter the free advertising Hannity and his ilk are providing to her unfit opponent.""

""The stakes of this election couldn't be higher,"" Peters contended. ""If alt-right extremists like Hannity succeed in getting their man into the White House the public airwaves will continue to be polluted by anti-social rants. It is more important than ever that we elect Hillary. She will appoint the people we need to the FCC and the courts to ensure that broadcast communications are permanently cleansed of nonconforming counterrevolutionary opinions.""

Hillary Hammers Trump's Pitch to Black Voters

GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump's bid to woo black votes by persuading them that Democratic policies have ruined their lives was denounced by rival candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a major policy speech she gave in Reno, Nevada this week.

""Democrats and blacks have been together for a long time,"" Clinton told a crowd that easily surpassed double digits. ""It's kind of like we have a 'common law marriage.' It's outrageous for an outsider like Trump to try to alienate our mutual affections. Sure there have been some rough patches. Every marriage has rough patches. Bill and I have had some rough patches, but we've always stuck together. Each of us has been there to aid and abet the other's dreams and aspirations. Blacks and Democrats need to stick together for the same reason.""

""Trump promises to put black people to work,"" Hillary pointed out. ""But whites putting black people to work sounds like slavery to me. The Democratic Party has freed black people from the burdens of work. Democrats have enacted laws to ensure that if your man walks out on you the government will put a roof over your head and food on the table. Thanks to legislation championed by the Democratic Party no one has to do hard labor to survive.""

""Trump promises to make the streets safe by locking up criminals,"" Hillary observed. ""But this is a thinly veiled declaration of war against the black man. As we have seen 'law and order' leads to a racially imbalanced prison population. Democrats are against laws and enforcement that fall disproportionately on racial minorities. The prison population should mirror the free population. I will work toward achieving this goal.""

""I caution blacks not to buy into Trump's idea that acting white is the way to a better life,"" Hillary warned. ""From our nation's earliest days it has been the Democratic Party that has taken care of blacks. Republicans have been the ones ready to cast them out into the world to fend for themselves. Voters should remember this on election day.""

In related news, Will Quigg, a grand dragon of the California Ku Klux Klan chapter, endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. ""History has shown that Democrats have been the Party with the guts to keep the blacks in their place, they even fought a war to preserve white rights,"" Quigg reminded. ""LBJ's Great Society plan to concentrate the blacks in public housing compounds and fatten them up on food stamps keeps them from taking the jobs that belong to whites.""

State Department Warns Americans to Avoid Traveling

The State Department issued a warning to US citizens advising them to avoid foreign travel for the ""foreseeable future."" The warning was sparked by what the Department characterized as ""an unfortunate misunderstanding of a recent multi-million dollar payment to Iran.""

""We thought we were paying off an amount due Iran from the cancellation of the Shah's 1979 purchase of jet fighters,"" explained Payton Moore, Undersecretary for Islamic Relations. ""The government of Iran thought we were paying ransom for four Americans they were holding prisoner until a plane delivering the $400 million in cash arrived in their country. Now the Iranian government has instructed police and military units to take more American 'criminals' into custody for future exchanges.""

The misunderstanding was confirmed when Iranian Minister of Commerce, Mehdi Ghazanfari, bragged that ""the exchange of American spies for cash compensation is the most efficacious investment available to us. The return excedes that of any other industry that we could conceivably undertake.""

The Minister recommended expanding the scheme to include ""arresting Iranians with relatives who are American citizens. The loyalty of anyone with family in the United States is suspect. We can test their loyalty to Iran by inducing them to invite family members for a visit. We can then arrest the visiting Americans and earn a generous profit by ransoming them back to the US government.""

Ghazanfari hastened to point out that ""this doesn't mean we shouldn't continue to export Muslim refugees to countries where they can collect welfare benefits. As the Quran tells us, it is every Muslim's right to receive the jizya from the kafirs. The benefits aren't as robust as they ought to be, but as more Muslims attain citizenship in the western countries they will use their votes to remedy this deficiency.""

In related news, the US State Department announced that ""as a courtesy to former Secretary Hillary Clinton"" it won't be releasing her 2009-2013 appointment calendar until after the November election. Department spokesman Herman Hushman called it ""a simple case of helping out an alumna of the agency during a difficult time in her life.""

Zimbabwean Olympians Face Punishment

Zimbabwean President, Robert Mugabe had the nation's entire Olympic team arrested on their return home from the Rio games, saying ""we have wasted the country's money on these rats we call athletes.""

In his speech at the Democratic Convention President Obama contended that ""by so many measures, our country is stronger and more prosperous than it was when we started."" Unfortunately, a number of key statistics seem to contradict that assessment. There are 3 million more people in poverty. Household incomes for those in the bottom 20% declined. Nearly 9 million more individuals are receiving food stamps. And 14 million have left the workforce.

Press Secretary Josh Earnest insisted that ""these statistics need to be properly interpreted. Before we leap to a hasty conclusion that the President's policies have been ineffective let's consider what has really taken place. A mere increase in the number of persons below the poverty line is not a clear indication that they suffering. In our country, people below the poverty line are provided with amenitieslike air-conditioned apartments, cable TV, and cell phonesthat even the so-called middle class in other countries lack.""

""Why should we worry about earned incomes declining when the benefits offered by government are so generous?"" Earnest asked. ""Isn't the fact that people get to consume more important than whether they can afford to pay for it? Isn't the fact that more Americans are overweight than ever a sign that the increase in food stamps is a success? And don't get me started on the millions who have left the workforce. Surely being able to live without having a job is a step forward in human civilization. The gains in leisure have got to far outstrip any assumed loss of dignity from becoming dependent on others.""

Democrats Accuse Trump of Treason

The Wikileaks release of 20,000 Democratic National Committee emails show how Party officials rigged the presidential primary campaign to favor Hillary Clinton over Sen Bernie Sanders (S-Vt) confirmed what many have suspected for the last six months. DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (Fla) was quick to initiate a narrative blaming Russia for hacking into the DNC's server.

""That a foreign government with a long-running enmity to America could so easily break into confidential computer files of the Democratic Party is a matter of serious concern,"" she alleged. ""The public exposure of our private communications could influence the outcome of the November election. Such an invasion into a political process that is none of their business will not be forgotten.""

GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump called Wasserman-Schultz's concerns ""belated and self-serving. As I recall, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was recently reprimanded by the FBI for 'extraordinary carelessness' in her handling of classified government information on a non-secure computer. The odds that that server was hacked are extremely high. Foreign governments and criminals could have gotten a hold of sensitive information that could be used to the detriment of this country.""

While professing no knowledge of who might have done the hacking, Trump suggested that ""the Russians or whoever might be responsible should look for the 30,000 emails Hillary says she deleted."" Sen Claire McCaskill (D-Missouri) immediately labeled Trump's suggestion ""treason. Encouraging a foreign power to break into potentially classified communications violates the Logan Act.""

Trump Campaign Manager Paul Manafort called MacCaskill's remarks ""telling. According to Mrs. Clinton, the 30,000 missing emails were all of a personal nature and not part of the business of the State Department. That is how she justified deleting them despite her statutory obligation to turn over all her correspondence. Wouldn't the publication of those emails by Russia or whoever may have them vindicate Hillary's dubious contention?""

Clinton Campaign Manager Robbie Mook argued that ""the exposure of personal emails could still be an embarrassment. As we have seen from the publication from the DNC hack, emails with derogatory, demeaning, and insensitive content could be just as damaging as actual security breeches. Anything that could contribute to undermining respect for a prospective commander-in-chief is, in my opinion, treasonous.""

Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev) suggested that Trump's remarks ""disqualify him as a candidate. That he would side with hackers and encourage them to expose a great American's 'dirty laundry,' so to speak raises genuine questions regarding his loyalty to this country. Even if he thinks Secretary Clinton is a rat, she is our rat. Coming together to support one another is every patriot's obligation. Submerging our differences in pursuit of a unified collective whole is the sacrifice we all must make for the greater good.""

Reid went on to advise that Trump be given fake national security briefings in order to ""keep the nation's most precious secrets from this unworthy individual and to set him up for future campaign gaffes that will ensure his defeat in November.""

Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) seconded Reid's proposal in a letter to President Obama. ""A mindless adherence to the tradition of briefing both major candidates must not be allowed to block a sensible tool for ensuring a favorable outcome at the ballot box,"" Cicilline wrote.

In related news, the DNC issued a letter of apology to Sen. Sanders for ""shafting you during the primaries,"" but urged him to ""shake it off. Many athletic contests are marred by errant calls by umpires or referees, but the results are never overturned."" Sanders was advised to ""wait until 'next season' to mount a campaign to rectify this injustice.""

Clinton Campaign Disses Idea of Press Conferences

One tradition that has been notably absent from Hillary Clinton's campaign for the presidency has been press conferences where the media are invited to query the candidate.

""We'll have a press conference when we want to have a press conference,"" Clinton pollster Joel Benenson said on ABC News this past week. ""Our candidate is under no legal obligation to answer to the press. We will control what is said to whom and when it will be said. We acknowledge that this may be inconvenient from the media's perspective, but they'll just have to bear with it.""

Benenson also pointed out that ""it's not like the media is going to switch sides over this. More than 90% of them are with us on the issues. In a way, the lack of press conferences let's them off the hook. The effort they'd have to go to in order to appear even-handed has got to be stressful for them. By carefully controlling the exposition of our candidate's message we can all arrive at our commonly agreed upon destination with a minimum of fuss.""

Trump Places Competence Ahead of Compassion

Vice-President Joe Biden explained the difference between a Clinton and a Trump administration in a raucous speech to the Democratic National Convention, contending that Trump's catchphrase from his Apprentice reality show ""'you're fired,' reveals a gaping existential chasm between Democrats and Republicans.""

""Just because a person can't handle a job doesn't mean he doesn't need that job,"" Biden pointed out. ""Yet, Trump would callously cast employees aside based merely upon performance. Is this the kind of man we want to place at the head of our government?""

""In contrast, our nominee has the compassion to understand that competence is not the most important attribute we should seek from an employee,"" Biden said. ""The right frame of mind and the commitment to a shared social goal is far more valuable than whether an individual can get a job done. We can always add more employees if those we have on hand lack the skills needed to complete tasks.""

To those concerned that a ""compassionate"" approach might result in a bloated bureaucracy, Biden asked ""would it really be better to cast the so-called 'dead wood' out into the street? We are a rich country. We can easily afford keeping loyal civil servants on the payroll. I shudder to think what might have become of me had a harsh demand for performance been applied to me. Democratic voters have spared me the ignominy of finding out. By electing Hillary voters will spare millions of government employees from finding out.""

Democratic VP nominee Urges Voters to Trust Hillary Clinton

Freshly nominated Democratic Party candidate for vice-president Sen Tim Kaine took up the delicate issue of whether voters could afford to trust running mate Hillary Clinton.

""We've heard that her use of an insecure non-government computer server for her emails was too risky,"" Kaine recounted. ""We've heard that her neglect of security for the Benghazi Consulate was a dereliction of duty. We've heard FBI Director James Comey characterize her handling of classified information as 'extraordinarily careless.' We've seen that she lied on numerous occasions in efforts to conceal her illegal and dangerous behavior. However, I am asking voters to look past these mistakes and elect her president.""

""Naturally, many will wonder how they can be expected to ignore these seemingly serious shortcomings,"" Kaine said. ""Well, let's look at the biggest decision she's had to make since sewing up the nomination. Out of all the people she could have chosen as her running mate, she chose me. The brilliance of this one decision should blow away all fear that she can't be trusted to wisely govern. She had the integrity to bypass the obvious choice of naming rival Bernie Sanders as her VP. She had the guts not to latch on to the easy option of putting two-time VP Joe Biden on the ticket. She picked me. Since I know what a swell guy I am and what a great job I could do as president should the need arise, I am persuaded that voters can put their trust in her as president.""

John Kerry Reaches New Height of Idiocy

Secretary of State John Kerry reached a new height of idiocy this past week by suggesting air conditioners were just as dangerous as ISIS. The remarks came in Vienna where Kerry was representing the US in negotiations aimed at reducing emissions that contribute to global warming.

""Granted, the terror attacks carried out by these misguided individuals are splashy,"" Kerry observed. ""Dozens die and even more are maimed and injured, but the fact is that these effects are small-scale and of limited duration and consequence. We easily overlook some of the offsetting benefits. The people killed cease to be carbon emitters. This has a salutary impact on global temperatures.""

""In contrast, air-conditioning is much vaster in scope and impact,"" Kerry explained. ""It's a habit too many people have fallen into out of a selfish pursuit of their own comfort. Breaking this cycle is of greater urgency than our efforts to mitigate terror attacks.""

Despite the professed greater threat posed by air conditioning, the Secretary brushed aside suggestions that AC units at the State Department be turned off as an example to others. ""The comfort of those of us charged with the responsibility to lead this country cannot be sacrificed in a quixotic attempt to model exemplary behavior,"" Kerry said. ""Discomfort needs to be apportioned according to the importance, or lack thereof, of those being asked to endure it.""

2016-02-06,1454739680,"SEMI-NEWS/SEMI-SATIRE: February 7, 2016 Edition","New Clinton Defense on Email Scandal: ""Everybody Did It""

A recent discovery that former Secretaries of State Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice may have received a handful of classified emails on their private computers prompted Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to claim she's been exonerated.

""The vast right-wing conspiracy trying to derail my campaign has been rebutted by this new evidence,"" Hillary contended. ""Singling me out when the use of private computers for transmitting classified government communications was standard practice reveals the baseless hypocrisy of their charges.""

Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif) says ""Clinton's 'everybody did it' argument is a gross distortion of reality. It's akin to a notorious drunk driver with numerous moving violations endangering the lives of many asserting that she is no different from the law-breaker once cited for overstaying at a parking meter. Clinton's unsecured private server was explicitly intended to hide her communications from scrutiny. More than a thousand classified documents were found on it. Several were more sensitive than 'top secret.' Clearly, she intentionally flouted the law and, as a result, needlessly endangered national security.""

Clinton rejected Issa's stance as ""a bean-counter's approach to justice. Either having classified material on a private computer is right or it is wrong. If it is right, the number of times it occurs is irrelevant. If it is wrong, then allincluding former Republican Secretaries of Stateneed to face the same charges.""

Ironically, the candidate concluded her attempted exculpatory argument by pledging to make cybersecurity a top priority in her administration as president. ""The Hell I've had to go through over emails I thought were securely deleted was a tough, but important lesson,"" she maintained. ""No government official of cabinet rank or above should have to fear that his or her secrets can't be kept secret. Therefore, I am promising the American people that if they elect me to rule them I will protect these public servants from intrusions on their privacy and will use any means necessary to do so.""

In related news, Hillary outlined her litmus test for future Supreme Court appointments in her upcoming administration. ""Anyone I nominate will have to embrace progressive values,"" she told attendees at a New Hampshire rally. ""This includes a commitment to support a woman's unconstrained right to an abortion, full recognition of gay marriage, and the enforcement of the rights of everyone to choose their own gender identity and receive the universal acceptance and accommodation to which they are entitled by law.""

DC to Pay Criminals to Refrain from Crime

Washington, DC Councilman Kenyan McDuffie proposed and the City Council unanimously adopted a measure that will pay criminals to refrain from committing crimes. Under the plan, residents with a sufficiently impressive rap-sheet will be paid up to $9,000 in cash per year for each year they aren't convicted of a crime.

""This is not some lame-brained scheme that any smart aleck can game,"" McDuffie boasted. ""Only those who can document their criminal behavior will be eligible for the stipend. By paying the 'worst-of-the-worst' members of our community to cool it we will have a greater impact than if we put more cops on the street.""

The move met with an enthusiastic reception on the streets. A local community leader known only by his street moniker: ""The Big Banger,"" averred that ""we are always looking for ways to expand our cash flow. I think most of my guys have the reps to qualify for the payouts. Those few that don't could still crack a few heads or boost some merchandise if that's what it takes to get in on this.""

Apprised of ""Banger's"" comments, McDuffie said he was encouraged. ""I'm confident that if we partner with the people who really control the streets we can transform the social structure of our City. We've already got feelers out to both the Clinton and Sanders' campaigns to see if either will commit to this new way of restoring order to our society. It would be great to have a broader impact than just in DC.""

In related news, some DC welfare moms are unhappy with the free accommodations the City is providing. Due to a shortage of public housing 730 families are being housed in area hotels. The amenities include prepared meals, cable TV, internet WiFi access, and maid service. Tiera Williams complains that the two-room suite they gave her is ""too small, there aren't enough choices of food, the TV is only basic cable, and the maid wakes me up too early. The paying customers at the hotel get room service with a bigger menu and pay-per-view TV. Giving us less is discrimination. I thought Obama was supposed to transform America. Or do I have to wait for Sanders before everything is free for all?""

ISIS Recruits Assert ""Combat Immunity"" Defense

Five Minnesota men currently facing charges of criminal conspiracy after being caught preparing to go to Syria to fight for the Islamic State are demanding that charges be dismissed.

Moosli Krahp, attorney for the five, stipulated that ""the Islamic State has engaged in acts the rest of the world holds to be atrocious. However, these terror tactics are forced upon them by the superior firepower of their enemies. The West and its puppet allies can strike from the air. Civilians may be killed, but are quickly labeled 'collateral damage.' Well, the beheadings, torture, and similar actions carried out by the Islamic State are a necessary part asymmetric warfare. They are sanctioned by the government of the Islamic State and the soldiers who carry them out are not criminals. They are lawful combatants under the Geneva Conventions.""

""If the actual troops of the Islamic State are lawful combatants, then these five men, none of whom has yet to engage in combat, are merely future combatants, at best,"" Krahp said. ""Their apprehension inside the United States before they have had the opportunity to participate in the alleged atrocities is premature.""

Minnesota prosecutor Lars Hammarskjold rejected Krahp's arguments, but added ""even if we were to entertain the notion that these men are bonafide Islamic State combatants, they were caught outside of enemy lines and out of uniform. Under the Geneva Conventions that would make them spies subject to summary execution.""

In related news, legislation that would bar terrorists from receiving food stamps was introduced by Rep. Bruce Poliquin (R-Maine). Poliquin's bill isn't expected to succeed in becoming law. President Obama has already promised to veto it if it reaches his desk. ""The type of discrimination this legislation would institutionalize is an insult to our obligation to ensure the blessings of liberty are secured for all of our people,"" the President declared.

Former President Carter Endorses Trump

Former Democratic President Jimmy Carter says his favorite GOP candidate for president is Donald Trump. He explained the surprising endorsement by pointing out ""Trump is completely malleable. I don't think he has any fixed positions. From my perspective this is more preferable than a far right wing ideologue like Ted Cruz.""

""Cruz would clearly be an enemy of the progressive policies Obama has implemented,"" Carter continued. ""He'd try to undo them and would shut down the government if he felt it necessary to achieve his goals. With Trump I think we could be confident that wouldn't happen. Trump has been a good friend of the Democratic Party over the years. I think he would work with Democrats to try to improve upon and extend the gains already made.""

Trump expressed his gratification ""that a man who has held the office has made a wise choice"" and suggested that ""I'd be willing to consider former President Carter as a possible running mate. Putting someone with actual experience in the on-deck circle could make for a powerful combination. And the former president, unlike some in this race, is a natural born citizen.""

Carter said he was ""flattered to be considered by Mr. Trump, but he needs to understand, my view is merely that he is the least objectionable of the Republicans. I will, of course, support the Democratic Party's nominee.""

Perhaps a more significant boost to Trump's candidacy came via a survey indicating that 14% of federal employees say they will quit if he is elected president. Trump Campaign Manager Corey Lewandowski applauded the finding: ""While other candidates have to wrack their brains looking for ways to make government more efficient, Donald has already inspired a significant number of bureaucrats to declare they will 'self-deport' from the federal payroll once he's president. I'd say this gives Donald a leg up over the competition.""

Hillary Defends Huge Speaking Fees

Under a constant barrage of criticism from Democratic presidential rival Sen. Bernie Sanders for her cozy relationship with Wall Street, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton contended that she was just being polite in accepting $200,000 per hour for speeches she gave at Wall Street's request.

""Look, this is what they offered me,"" she explained. ""Was I supposed to have bargained for lower rates? If I had, would Senator Sanders now be accusing me of favoritism toward those firms? Let's not forget, in some instances I got even bigger speaking fees from universities. How could I, in good conscience, take less from the bankers than I took from the students?""

""As much as Bernie hates Wall Street shouldn't he be congratulating me from imposing a 'tax' on them and liberating that money from their greedy hands so the Clinton Foundation could put it to more socially beneficial purposes?"" Hillary speculated. I mean, how much money has he liberated from these corporate pirates?""

Meanwhile, despite Sanders' political demand that the government force every employer to pay every employee no less than $15 per hour, low level members of his staff receive only $12 per hour. Sanders sees no hypocrisy. ""I'm well within my rights,"" he insisted. ""Currently, there is no law that says I must pay them more. Besides, my beef is with the commercial segment of our society. A businessman's selfish desire to maximize profits is not protected under our Constitution. My right as a candidate for office to minimize my campaign expenses is.""

In related news, Clinton called an unlikely series of winning coin flips in all six Iowa caucus precincts that showed an equal number of votes for her and Sanders ""proof that God wants me to be president."" The mathematical odds of such an outcome: one in 64.

Obama Pitches Muslim TV Shows

Appalled by the over-representation of Muslims as terrorists in national security themed TV shows, President Obama called for broadcasters to air a more varied array of programs featuring Muslim characters.

""One idea I came up with is a family comedy,"" the President said. ""There's this daughter who refuses to marry the nephew her father has chosen for her. So, the father and nephew shoot her and dump the body in a river. But she comes back as a ghost or zombie and haunts them with a series of weekly pranks. In one episode the daughter disguises herself as salesperson in a supermarket and tricks her brother into eating a fried pork rind by telling him it's dry-roasted goat intestine. The father finds out and cuts the boy's tongue out as a punishment. The daughter returns and reveals herself. The father tries to kill her, but she's already dead, so he can't. Hilarity ensues.""

""Another idea I had is modeled on 'The Bachelor,'"" Obama exclaimed. ""Each week a young Muslim man will be asked to choose between a ten-year-old girl, boy, or donkey. He will be allowed to ask questions, grope the options, and use a 'lifeline' to the imam of his choice. After he makes his selection, the newly wed couple will be escorted to a small tent on the stage to consummate the marriage while the studio audience cheers them on.""

""These are just a couple of ideas off the top of my head,"" Obama admitted. ""I'm sure if Hollywood were to put its mind to it we could come up with more.""

In related news, the President blamed ""inexcusable political rhetoric for giving Americans a distorted impression of Muslims"" and ""are largely responsible for violent retaliation like we saw in San Bernardino last year. We need to end the cycle of violence by passing House Resolution 569 and outlaw, once and for all, the unnecessary and offensive disparagement of the Islamic faith in our country.""

2016-01-16,1452921655,"SEMI-NEWS/SEMI-SATIRE: January 17, 2016 Edition","NY Dems Demand Conservatives Leave State

While at odds over whether the State or the City should get to expropriate citizens' wealth, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo (D) and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) both agree that ""there is no place in the state for 'conservative extremists.'""

The extreme views deemed by Cuomo to be ""not who New Yorkers are,"" include ""opposition to abortion, refusal to accept gay marriage as the law of the land, and an anachronistic attachment to the notion that access to guns for self-defense can be tolerated in today's world.""

""These extreme views go beyond the bounds of civil disagreement and create a schism that endangers the very fabric of society,"" Cuomo contended. ""It would be best if those holding unacceptable political positions were to remove themselves from the state before something awful happens.""

""We all understand there's a right to free speech,"" de Blasio said. ""But the Governor is right. As chief executives of our respective jurisdictions we have a duty to protect citizens from having to listen to 'hateful words.' Those who characterize abortion as 'infanticide' hurt the feelings of the millions of New Yorkers who support this therapy for unwanted pregnancies. The fact that many who make such a characterization also support private ownership of firearms poses a threat to New Yorkers' values that government has an obligation to suppress.""

Obama Rejects Idea that Women Should Arm Themselves

When a rape victim queried President Obama at his recent town hall meeting to promote his latest set of executive actions impeding acquisition of firearms by law-abiding citizens he rejected her notion that having a gun for her own protection was her best option.

""I'm sorry you were raped,"" the President told Kimberly Corban, ""but fortunately you weren't killed. Most rape victims are not killed. If we allow you to have a weapon, though, the risk of someone getting killed jumps up to an unacceptable level. You acknowledge that your assailant was unarmed. You both came away from the encounter alive and without life-threatening injuries. I call that a 'win-win' outcome compared to what might have happened if you had pulled a gun to try to prevent the rape.""

Corban, who has struggled with depression, PTSD and stress-related seizures since she was raped was neither persuaded nor mollified by the President's response or his reasoning. ""The restrictions President Obama is adding make it harder for me to own a gun or harder for me to take that where I need to be is actually just making my kids and I less safe,"" she asserted. ""His fear that I might accidentally shoot myself or, as he put it, 'unjustly impose a death penalty on my attacker' conveys a total lack of sympathy or understanding.""

In related news, MSNBC decided not to do an interview with Juanita Broaddrick, a woman who says Bill Clinton raped her in 1978, ""because, as it turns out it's just old news. The alleged rape took place nearly 40 years ago. The statute of limitations expired long ago,"" said network spokesman Moe Lester. ""Even though it is candidate Hillary Clinton's position that 'every survivor of sexual assault deserves to be heard, believed, and supported,' we do not believe the current campaign should be diverted from more pressing issues by listening to an aged rape victim's accusations.""

German Government Urges Non-Muslims to Stay off Streets ""for Own Safety""

The German government's inability to cope with the flood of refugees Chancellor Angela Merkel invited into the country took an even more distressing turn when all non-Muslims were urged to stay off the streets for their own safety. Reports that police have been ordered not to interfere with unruly mobs of Muslim men out of fear that arresting these lawbreakers would be perceived as ""racist"" has left citizens and police uneasy.

""We thought we were letting in women and orphans as a humanitarian gesture, but 95% of the refugees appear to be footloose young men with no manners and no respect for the law,"" complained a frightened Berliner. ""It's the worst things have been in Germany been since Soviet troops ravaged our cities and our women in 1945.""

Frustrated police claim they are under pressure to falsify reports in order to make crimes seem less serious. ""One refugee tried to cut another's throat,"" an officer requesting anonymity explained. ""Normally, we'd write this up as 'attempted murder.' But the higher-ups told us to classify this as 'a minor scuffle with slight injuries.' Our basic rule of thumb is it's better to just let the perps run away.""

Dept of Health and Human Services Hails Gains in Able-Bodied Adults on Food Stamps

Since President Obama took office the number of able-bodied-without-dependents who are receiving government food subsidies has soared by 370%. This increase in participation by persons who in another era would have been expected to fend for themselves was hailed as ""great progress on the President's goal of transforming America,"" by Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell. ""Relieved of the burden of feeding themselves, these individuals are free to pursue goals higher on Maslow's hierarchy of needs.""

One of the favorite ""higher goals"" of this segment of the population is smoking. Fully 50% of the subsidized beneficiaries are smokers and spend about $111 per month on the habit.

Unfazed by the food subsidy's enabling recipients to indulge in unhealthy behavior, Burwell boasted that ""we also have a vigorous anti-smoking educational campaign to try to offset this unfortunate byproduct of what everyone recognizes as an essential humanitarian undertaking. And if our education efforts fail, fiscal hawks ought to appreciate the budgetary advantages of earlier mortality among those who do smoke.""

Planned Parenthood Sues Anti-Abortion Group

Planned Parenthood (PP) has filed suit against the Center for Medical Progress (CMP) alleging that ""CMP has callously and covertly exposed us to suspicion and ridicule by airing private negotiations for the illegal sale of body parts salvaged from terminated fetuses.""

The suit alleged irreparable harm including ""loss of taxpayer funding of abortions in some states, a decline in donations from benefactors horrified by the videos' portrayal of dismembered fetuses, insensitive Planned Parenthood officials and their rampant enthusiasm for turning unwanted human waste into useful items like expensive cars and bonuses for Planned Parenthood personnel.""

Congresswoman Diane Black (R-Tenn) labeled the suit ""an attempt to intimidate Planned Parenthood's critics. Most of America was appalled to learn of the crass and cruel practices going on at Planned Parenthood. Most of America is opposed to forcing taxpayers to subsidize the human sacrifice taking place behind closed doors of this manager of abattoirs for the most helpless of our species.""

Cecile Richards, President of Planned Parenthood Federation of America argued that ""regardless of whether the activities disclosed in the videos is criminal, there is a proper procedure for going forward. That procedure requires that a warrant be obtained before any taping is done. This procedure protects the rights of mafia racketeers and it also protects the private dealings of Planned Parenthood. The so-called evidence obtained by CMP was not undertaken after a judge-approved warrant. It is, therefore 'fruit from the tainted tree' and inadmissible as evidence of any wrongdoing by Planned Parenthood. At the same time, it is irrefutable proof that CMP has grossly invaded Planned Parenthood's privacy.""

The suit demands that ""all of CMP's videos be erased, all its assets be seized and confiscated, and that all the principals at CMP be punished to the maximum extent permitted by law.""

In related news, Hillary Clinton vowed to make abortions free if she is elected president later this year. ""Rich people who can afford to pay can have all the abortions they want,"" Clinton pointed out. ""Poor people shouldn't have fewer rights just because they can't afford to pay for their abortions. It is government's obligation to ensure equal rights for all. I will guarantee that abortion is a right that no one has to pay for when I'm president.""

Sanders Refuses to Explain How He will Pay for All the Free Stuff He's Promising

Socialist candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination Sen. Bernie Sanders refused to answer any questions about how his Administration will pay for the plethora of taxpayer-subsidized loot he is promising to voters, saying that ""it would spoil the surprise.""

""Does anyone demand that Santa Claus lay out a budget for all the gifts he gives?"" Sanders wanted to know. ""On one level, it would be rude to look a gift horse in the mouth. From a more practical standpoint, if I tip my hand ahead of time the people I'm going to ask to bear the expense may try to move their property out of my reach.""

The candidate contended that ""it should be enough for voters to know that I will be taking from those who have more than they should in order to give to those who have less than they should. People should have faith that their government can be trusted to do the right thing. I am the candidate who will restore that faith.""

Pelosi Justifies $150 Billion Payout to Iran

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif) acknowledged that ""Iran may do bad things with the $150 billion that will be released to them as part of the deal negotiated by the Obama Administration.

""Will they fund terrorist cells?"" Pelosi asked. ""Undoubtedly, but these terrorists will only kill thousands. A nuclear weapon could kill millions. Under this premise, paying billions that would enable terrorists to kill thousands seems a worthwhile trade off.""

""Sometimes you've got to make a deal with the devil,"" she added. ""For example, look at the deal Chamberlain made with Hitler in 1938. A small sliver of land in Czechoslovakia was ceded to Germany. Did Germany do bad things to the people living in this land? Yes, but the deal bought almost a year's worth of peace before the start of World War II. In the Iran deal we're buying ten year's worth of peace at the risk of a few thousand casualties. It's clear to me that we're making a good purchase.""

Obama Blames Economic Stagnation on Republicans Behaving Selfishly

Rather than consider the possibility that the sluggish performance of the economy during his presidency may have something to do with his policies, President Obama blamed everything on ""the GOP's selfish unwillingness to accept the will of the people and support my agenda.""

It is difficult to grasp the President's logic, though, since Congress, both before and after the GOP had the majority, has essentially acquiesced in every one of the President's budget requests and has failed to block any of the Administration's regulatory initiatives or executive actions.

""The GOP leadership in Congress may have funded the programs, but they refused to silence their Party's extremists who continually railed against what they called tyranny,"" Obama complained. ""This undermined the faith of the people in their government and bred a fatal skepticism that questioned the wisdom of an expansive, humane, and nurturing state.""

The President acknowledged that ""I didn't exploit all of my options to the fullest extent. We let the IRS intimidate conservative opponents of my agenda, but we could've gone further. The FBI has a rich lode of embarrassing information that we did not use as assiduously as we might have. And there were options that I, as Commander-in-Chief could have ordered our military to carry out against these domestic enemies.""

In related news, Obama vowed he would veto legislation introduced by House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) that would reduce presidential pensions for those making more than $400,000 per year after leaving office. ""Cutting my pension based on the premise that the millions I expect to earn from books and speeches means I don't need the money is unfair,"" Obama complained. ""I earned that pension from eight years of selfless public service. It is not the government's role to supplant the rewards I'm owed for my effort by redistributing public funds due me based on someone else's arbitrary notion about what I don't need. That's socialism. I won't stand for it.""

Okay, so this person admits that she has always been poor and always worked crappy jobs. Okay that sucks.

She even suggests that she went without eating sometimes to make her budget work.

Okay again that sucks.

She's also unmarried. She's engaged but it sounds like her kids are older.

She also lives in a house that her grandparents rent to her for super cheap because she presumably can't afford decent housing.

Now of course I don't know the whole story but knowing what we do...

...why the fuck did she choose to have kids?

I struggle to feel sorry for her. I feel terrible for the kids because their mom willingly choose to bring them into a world when any reasonable person would conclude they can't afford to support them.

If you can't afford to feed YOURSELF and you can't afford to house YOURSELF what on earth are you having kids for?

The smarmy, entitled tone just makes it worse.

Recent revelations that the Clinton Foundation neglected to report over $26 million in payments from major corporations, universities, foreign sources and other groups was characterized as ""a mere oversight"" by Foundation Chief Executive Officer Donna Shalala.

""The Foundation has raised more than $2 billion dollars over the years its been in existence,"" Shalala pointed out. ""The $26 million everyone is hyperventilating over is relative pocket change amounting to barely 1% of the total. It's on a par with a Congressman failing to report a free vacation from a lobbyist or a waiter forgetting to report all his tip income to the IRS. It's no big deal.""

Others aren't so sure it isn't a big deal. Peter Schweizer, author of the book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich, wondered ""why a Nigerian newspaper paid former president Bill Clinton $500,000 for a speech. And if it was all legit, why was this payment among the $26 million the Foundation 'forgot' to report?""

""As everyone knows, the Clintons were flat broke when Bill's term as president was over,"" Shalala said in response. ""Why should anyone begrudge him earning a little money from sharing his wisdom on the talk circuit? Isn't it time that the harassment and persecution of one of America's great families come to an end?""

Bush Defends Warrantless Government Surveillance

While one GOP presidential candidate filibustered legislation extending the National Security Agency's (NSA) authority to spy on Americans, another alleges that ""there's not a shred of evidence that this surveillance has violated anyone's civil liberties.""

GOP presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ken) spoke for 10 hours on the floor of the Senate contending that NSA's warrantless violations of privacy are unconstitutional. ""The Fourth Amendment was intended to protect us from unreasonable searches,"" Rand argued. ""It calls for government to obtain a warrant from a judge based on 'probable cause.' The gathering of massive amounts of private information without such warrants flies in the teeth of the Amendment's prohibition. We should be abolishing this intrusion, not extending it.""

Prospective rival for the Republican nomination, former Florida Governor JEB Bush disagreed, calling the NSA ""a virtual guardian angel watching over and protecting us. I just can't buy the argument that we have anything to fear from our own government. They're on our side. We need to give them all the power and tools they say they need to keep us safe.""

Bush said that ""the fact that the only people killed so far based on information gathered by the NSA are enemies of our government ought to reassure everyone that as long as they behave themselves they have nothing to fear. So the government knows who you phone, email and tweet. So what, as long as you're not doing anything wrong why should you care? I don't find the so-called scare phrase 'Big Brother is watching you' particularly frightening. The whole idea behind the NSA originated with my big brother and he's a swell guy. We should be glad that he helped develop a program to watch over us.""

Hillary Defends Benghazi Lies

Evidence that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was informed that the assault on the Benghazi Consulate and murder of Ambassador Stevens was a planned terrorist attack before she went public with the misleading cover story of a video protest gone bad failed to dislodge her from defending it.

""Sure, we knew within hours of the Ambassador's death that the attack had been planned at least 10 days in advance, but for us to have publicly acknowledged this would have put the country into even greater danger,"" Clinton maintained. ""Remember, this attack occurred just two months ahead of a presidential election. Our first priority was to counteract the domestic insurgency being led by Mitt Romney. Staving off this attempt to overthrow our government was more important than adhering to some quaint notions of honesty.""

Clinton characterized the bogus video-inspired-uprising story as akin to President Roosevelt's feigning surprise at Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. ""Imagine the damage that would have been done to his government if he hadn't seized control of the narrative,"" she hypothesized. ""By diverting attention away from our lack of preparedness and onto Japan's treachery he was able to rally the American people and save his government. Why shouldn't we have emulated a man most historians agree was one of our greatest presidents?""

In related news, Clinton's presidential campaign manager disputed press claims that her motorcade reached speeds in excess of 95 mph on the way to a fund raiser in Iowa. ""While the media vehicles following the motorcade may have sped, we did not,"" Robbie Mook asserted, attributing the quick transit time to ""our use of new technology allowing us to travel using a 'worm hole' through hyperspace. The confusion afflicting those still confined to normal three-dimensional space is understandable.""

Candidate Says ""Everything Will Be Free When I'm President""

Self-described socialist and candidate for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders promised voters that ""everything will be free when I'm president.""

""In a country as rich as ours it is shameful that mere lack of money should block anyone from having all the good things of life,"" Sanders said. ""No one should be stigmatized by having to grovel to qualify for food stamps or be denied entry into college because they can't afford it or don't have good high school grades. Anyone who wants to eat should simply be permitted to take food from a grocery store or restaurant. Anyone who wants to go to college should be allowed in, no questions asked.""

Payment for all these freebies will come from a confiscatory tax on excess assets and income. ""Only pure arrogance drives the notion that people who are smarter and harder-working should get more than those less well-endowed by nature or nurture,"" the Senator contended. ""Just because you are lucky enough to inherit intelligence or learn to be enterprising from the good example of your parents doesn't mean you earned it. A person born to stupid and shiftless parents isn't at fault for his lack of effort. Why then should his rewards be contingent on the exertions he doesn't make?""

""Every human being is entitled to an equal share of the Earth's bounty,"" Sanders declared. ""Ensuring an equitable distribution is government's responsibility. Voters can count on me to fulfill this responsibility.""

Pay Hike Needed to Boost Congress' Morale

Several Democrats, including Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (Md), made the case for higher compensation this week citing ""the low morale among those of us in the legislature who can only salivate at the sums being hauled in by ex-presidents and others for trifling amounts of work. As members of a body of 435 we won't have the same name recognition. We won't be invited to pontificate on sundry topics for piles of cash.""

Rep. Alcee Hastings (D-Fla) seconded Hoyer's remarks saying ""we need to get a bigger piece of the pie now! We pass laws doling out billions to important constituencies, yet we get dinged for accepting gratuities in exchange. It's just not fair.""

Hastings went on to complain that ""the $174,000 annual salary is barely four times the median household income in this country. It's humiliating for members of the ruling class to have to scrape by on such a pittance. Plus, if our salaries were higher those hoping to influence policy would be encouraged to up the amounts they pay for our efforts to deliver the goods.""

Hoyer also warned of ""a possible exodus of the best and brightest from public service if we don't take action to increase the rewards. The loss of human capital from the departure of legislators who have served for decades would be catastrophic. Congress would likely degenerate into a body staffed by short-term citizen-legislators instead of long-term professionals who dedicate their lives to wielding power for the common good.""

Kerry Calls for Stricter Government Regulation of Internet

In a speech in South Korea US Secretary of State John Kerry called for government to play a bigger role in what goes on the Internet. Kerry advised that ""we take a lesson from what's going on in North Korea. Sure, there are a lot of things wrong with the way Kim is governing his country, but that doesn't mean everything he's doing is a mistake.""

""A key positive in Kim's policies is the government's larger role in filtering what the citizens of North Korea can see and hear from the Internet,"" the Secretary maintained. ""Antisocial content that could undermine his people's contentment is severely dealt with. Positive messages aimed at raising the people's sense of well-being are encouraged. This helps boost the people's faith in their government.""

""There's some good lessons we in the West can learn from Kim's model,"" Kerry argued. ""Granted, we wouldn't want to resort to executing every dissident, but there are less bloodthirsty methods of enforcing compliance with the values and practices that will help stamp out the evils of racism, hate speech, and sedition that infest the unregulated Internet that currently prevails in the United States.""

Kerry concluded his remarks with ""a wish that the independent Federal Communication Commission will not let President Obama down by allowing an unwarranted respect for freedom of speech to cloud their judgment.""

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) warned financial institutions that they could be prosecuted if they deny home loans to persons subsisting on welfare benefits.

CFPB Director Richard Cordray asserted that ""placing ability to repay ahead of need is contrary to federal regulations. Just because a person cannot support himself or herself doesn't mean he or she should be excluded from the benefits of home ownership. Every person has an inalienable right to own a home. Lenders have a moral obligation to help people achieve this right.""

""For banks to argue that the risks of default and foreclosure should preclude certain persons from obtaining loans places profit over social justice,"" Cordray said. ""Those who attempt to implement such injustice will face consequences. Fines or even imprisonment await anyone who would defy us in this matter.""

Cordray went on to question ""whether requiring loans to be repaid even makes sense. Housing costs would be lower across-the-board if the burden of repayment could be lifted from those unable to afford it. Banks have billions of dollars and could easily absorb the losses from non-performing loans. If they should become insolvent the Federal Reserve would, as it has in the past, just create more money to bail them out.""

In related news, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is considering eliminating in-person interviews for Food Stamp applicants. Secretary Tom Vilsack explained that ""forcing applicants to meet face-to-face is unnecessarily humiliating for them. I mean, having to look a government official in the eye and ask for help is intimidating. It might deter some from even seeking aid and try to make it on their own. By allowing applicants to simply phone-in a request for Food Stamps we can better maximize the volume of aid we provide.""

Global Warming Activists Demand Media Stop Calling Unbelievers ""Skeptics""

The Citizen Engagement Laboratory (CEL) wants news outlets to stop using the term ""skeptics"" for those who question the global climate change meme. Instead, those who fail to adhere to the accepted view are to be universally referred to as ""deniers.""

CEL Director Ronald Deibert complained that ""using the word 'skeptic' makes opposition to our theory of global climate change sound reasonable. It implies that their assertion that evidence is needed to prove that mankind is the source of climate change deserves a hearing. It implies that the science of global warming is not settled, that differing interpretations of the data are permissible. Is this something we should allow?""

""If we can eliminate the term 'skeptic' and uniformly replace it with 'denier' we can cast these doubters into the ranks of those who don't deserve to be heard,"" Deibert declared. ""'Denier' connotes an air of unjustified disbelief. No one need pay attention to the rantings of 'deniers' like those who deny that the Holocaust ever took place. Why should those who deny the reality of man-made climate change be treated any better?""

Deibert says he fears that ""if we allow unacceptable views to continue to pollute the debate it will be that much more difficult to gain broad public acquiescence for the sacrifices we all must make to combat the threat. The slightest smidgen of doubt could derail the taxes and regulations necessary to avert disaster.""

Dean Claims Jesus More Leftist than Democratic Party

This week, former Vermont Governor Howard Dean claimed that ""Jesus was more to the left than the Democratic Party. Look, Jesus threw the money changers out of the temple. We Democrats are content to merely tax and regulate them.""

""If you listen closely to Jesus' words about rendering unto Caesar what is Caesar's, it seems clear that all the money properly belongs to the government,"" Dean maintained. ""Democrats haven't gone that far. We still permit people to keep some of the money they earn.""

""You know, Jesus didn't work a steady job,"" Dean observed. ""While he was traipsing about the desert he was living off of handouts. Yet, the so-called 'religious right' assails those who accept handouts as a way of life today as shiftless and parasitic. Maybe it is they who are out-of-sync with Jesus' message.""

In related news, President Obama castigated churches, saying that ""those who focus more on abortion and gay marriage than eradicating poverty are out-of-step with Jesus' teachings. Jesus urged people to give away their wealth. If Congress would adopt more progressive taxation the government could help make this happen.""

""Can we be so sure Jesus would have condemned abortion or gay rights?"" Obama wondered. ""It seems to me that Jesus cared a lot about women. Why wouldn't he care about their reproductive health? And didn't Jesus spend a lot of time in the company of the apostlesall men? He never married as would have been normal for a Jew in those days. Can we be sure that Jesus himself was not gay?""

Obama Calls for Change in How the Media Reports

Citing the ""especially grievous slant that FOX gives to the news,"" President Obama called for ""better policing of the public airways to prevent this intellectual pollution.""

""When I see how FOX is constantly undermining what I am trying to do for America by pointing out every flaw and defect of my policies I feel sorry for America,"" the President said. ""How can our people be joyful if their TVs are parading so-called failures in front of them in their own living rooms?""

""The abuse of freedom of the press and freedom of speech for the purpose of destroying faith in government is seditious,"" Obama contended. ""We should not sit by and let this go out of some reverence for the outmoded ideas of America's founders. New times require new rules if we are to promote the general welfare.""

An idea that is starting to gain some traction inside the Administration is to employ the Federal Communications Commission to ""fact check"" all news broadcasts. ""We owe it to the American people to ensure that the news they receive is accurate,"" said FCC Chairman Thomas Wheeler. ""No one has the right to inject inaccurate information or disloyal opinions into the nation's communication system. The FCC has a wide range of tools it can and should use to clean up what is broadcast, transmitted, or posted to the web. My biggest regret is that we let things go too far and had to be reminded by the President to do our duty.""

Senator Says NFL Priorities ""Screwed Up""

The announcement that the New England Patriots and Quarterback Tom Brady would be penalized for cheating drove Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev) into a frenzy.

""I find it stunning that the NFL cares more about how much air is in a football than it cares about a racist franchise name,"" Reid raved. ""No one need have known about the under-inflated balls. Covertly tipping the scales is simply business-as-usual. By going public with this scandal the NFL has 'shot itself in the foot,' and to what end?""

""The much more serious offense is the refusal of the Washington team to change its name,"" Reid argued. ""Correct opinion concurs that the name 'Redskins' is an insult to Native Americans. For the team owners to persist in swimming against the tide of history in this matter can only lead to bad results.""

Potential ""bad results"" that Reid claims to foresee include ""massive lawsuits filed by aggrieved Native Americans, government seizing the team from the owners, and street riots like we've seen in Baltimore.""

Bush Would Use Obama Immigration Order to Extort Legislation from Congress

Potential candidate for president and former Governor of Florida JEB Bush told FOX News' Megyn Kelly that ""unlike some other GOP presidential contenders, I would not move to immediately undo President Obama's executive action granting special privileges to illegal immigrants. Instead, I would refuse to revoke it until Congress passed appropriate enabling legislation. In any case, the American voter can count on me to see that legalizing those in this country illegally will go forward with or without legislation.""

Bush acknowledged the shaky legality of Obama's executive action, but averred that ""doing the right thing is more important than confining policy to narrowly circumscribed authority. I could not, in good conscience, do nothing simply because there is no statutory authority for the action I deem morally necessary.""

The candidate said he hoped ""my willingness to go beyond what the law allows will help set me apart from those who would allow themselves to be limited by the constraints of immoral laws. The American people need a leader who is not afraid to stake out new ground and to chart a path that others can follow. Congress will be invited to come along if they cooperate, but I will not allow them to apply the brakes to what needs to be done.""

In related news, JEB characterized his endorsement of big brother George's Iraq War as ""basic self-preservation. When we were growing up George always used to bully me if I crossed him. It didn't matter whether he was right or wrong. If he didn't get what he wanted he'd beat me up.""

While it would seem that the era of big brother George beating up little brother JEB must have long passed, the younger Bush alleges that ""emotional scarring led to my knee-jerk statement in support of my brother's invasion of Iraq. I'm just hoping that every little brother who votes will understand my reaction and forgive my fumbling of this issue. For the record, knowing what we know now, it's clear that Syria is the place we should invade.""",Conservative,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/3646rk/seminewssemisatire_may_17_2015_edition/

Suspicion that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton may have been involved in questionable financial transactions between foreign governments and the Clinton Foundation was brushed aside as a ""matter of no interest"" by Department spokesman Jeff Rathke.

""Secretary Clinton has assured us that there were no improprieties,"" Rathke said. ""We 'd have to have some concrete proof before we 'd undertake any moves that could impugn her integrity. Now that her private server has been erased it doesn't look like there could ever be any concrete proof.""

""Personally, I find it hard to believe that a woman who has dedicated here life to public service could be influenced by any amount of money to deviate from pursuing the public good,"" Rathke added. ""Besides, the Clintons are already quite wealthy. They'd have no need to engage in anything so sordid as taking bribes in exchange for favorable policies or actions by the State Department.""

Rathke's views appeared to conflict with those of State Department Assistant Secretary Joyce Barr who characterized Clinton's use of a private server for official business as ""not acceptable"" in testimony at a Senate Judiciary hearing. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) used a bit stronger language saying Clinton's actions ""amounted to a premeditated and deliberate violation of the law.""

Lawyers for Clinton rejected these allegations and contended that ""the private server gave the nation an added layer of security. A government server would have been vulnerable to a 'freedom of information' disclosure of its contents, but her private server could be and was simply erasedprotecting vital secrets from unwarranted prying.""

In related news, Hillary Clinton's campaign declined to disclose who its major donors are. Campaign Manager Robbie Mook said ""revelation of the names of key donors will remain confidential. The only reason why people demand to know names is so they can try to intimidate these donors and deny the candidate the resources she needs to fight for the rights of everyday Americans. Anonymity is an important protection with significant historical precedence. We will resist all efforts to breach this protection.""

Black Panther Leaders Say More White People Need to Get Hurt

Spokesmen for the New Black Panther Party called for actions designed to ""put the hurt on white people"" as a means for ""addressing centuries of oppression of Black folks.""

Former national chairman of the New Black Panther Party and current national president of Black Lawyers for Justice, Malik Zulu Shabazz, urged Baltimore rioters to ""strike back in self-defense against the police. The Mayor invited the victims of oppression to take revenge and reparations against the society that has harmed them. Those who stand in the way have no one to blame but themselves if they get hurt.""

New Black Panther Party, Chief of Staff Michelle Williams and King Samir Shabazz, upped the ante by calling on rioters ""to firebomb nurseries so that they can kill as many white babies as possible."" Shabazz characterized this as ""the most effective way to make our case. Pulling white people out of their homes, skinning them alive, and dragging them behind trucks is what they deserve, but it's too risky. Some of these whites have guns, but none of the white babies can fight back and the deaths of these innocents will cause the most pain to our white oppressors.""

In related news, Islamic Imam Anjem Choudary claimed it is his ""Constitutional right to publicly urge Muslims to murder Pamela Geller for hosting a blasphemous draw Mohammed contest. Under the US Constitution my right to practice my religion is guaranteed. My religion condemns all disrespect for the Prophet and prescribes death for anyone who violates this command. I cannot be prohibited from proclaiming this tenet of our doctrine. Neither can any Muslim be legally prohibited from slaughtering the blasphemer.""

White House Against GOP Attempts to Restrict How Iran Spends Released Funds

A component of the forthcoming agreement between the US and Iran on nuclear weapons development is the US release of Iranian funds that have been frozen in US banks. GOP critics of the agreement fear that these funds will be used to aid terrorist attacks in the Middle East and elsewhere.

Press Secretary Josh Earnest mocked these fears as ""paranoid delusions. It would make no sense for the Iranians to besmirch the rapport our two countries have worked so hard to achieve by 'stabbing us in the back' with such a duplicitous response to our generosity.""

Earnest cited ""the historic precedent set by President Franklin Roosevelt's policy of giving Stalin everything he wanted while asking nothing in return as evidence that trusting Iran to do the right thing will work out over the long run. Stalin did everything we could have hoped for when FDR extended this trust in their intentions.""

Earnest brushed off Stalin's initiation of the Iron Curtain and the Cold War as ""a predictable reaction to Truman's post-war anti-communist policies. It was Truman who sent aid to Europe under the Marshall Plan with the express purpose of helping these war-torn nations resist communist inroads. This direct challenge to the Soviet Union's interests provoked Stalin's hostility. Today's GOP mistrust of Iran threatens to repeat Truman's errors.""

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei rejected the idea that any conditions could be attached to how his country spends the released funds. ""We are a sovereign nation,"" Khamenei said. ""How we handle our funds is no one else's business.""

Educational Standards Demanding Hard Work Called Discriminatory

California's Pacific Educational Group (PEG) denounced educational standards that require students to study and work hard in order to graduate as ""discrimination against Black students.""

PEG co-chair Kenneth K. Knowlton asserted that ""Blacks are less likely to respond to fundamental ideas like working hard to achieve success, or being on time for school or work. The notion that such attitudes ought to be instilled in every student is a racist endeavor that seeks to submerge this vital subculture.""

""What's more, the contention that hard work is a key to success is belied by reality,"" Knowlton maintained. ""A significant segment of the Black subculture has learned to survive on government benefit programs that do not require hard work. Adapting to these programs is a viable low-energy route to reasonably comfortable subsistence in our society. In terms of return on investment or effort it is very efficient. A school's attempt to divert students from this efficient path does them a disservice.""

A statistic bolstering Knowlton's claims was obtained from a Department of Agriculture study indicating that 40% of the people on Food Stamps are obesea finding that Knowlton contended ""debunks the old-fashioned thinking that warns of the privation awaiting those who don't put forth the effort to support themselves.""

In related news, British academic Adam Swift charged that ""parents who read to their children are giving them an unfair advantage over children whose parents are unable or unwilling to read to their children. Evidence shows that the difference between those who get bedtime stories and those who don't  the difference in their life chances  is bigger than the difference between those who get elite private schooling and those that don't. For the sake of equality of opportunity we ought to figure out a way to interdict this type of selfish behavior.""

Swift lamented the improbability for success ""as long as children are entrusted to the care of their own parents. If all children could be separated from their parents at an early age and raised by childcare professionals, a more uniform experience would be more easily ensured. All or none could be read to as seems most conducive to the collective well-being of society.""

""Persons walking the streets should not be faced with such an intrusive violation of their privacy,"" declared ACLU spokesman Bertram Petty. ""Officials need to present a 'probable cause' case to observe a specific individual suspected of a specific crime. They have no authority for a general surveillance of an entire city.""

Petty also questioned whether the looting and burning would even qualify as crimes, per se. ""The title to the property being removed from the businesses is unclear,"" Petty argued. ""Some of the ancestors of the current white business owners were surely slaveholders. The wealth passed down to them was obtained by the exploitation of the ancestors of some of the current looters. On top of this, any pain they may have suffered from seeing their businesses burn can't possibly exceed the pain suffered by slaves who were whipped or worse by their white masters.""

President Obama endorsed the ACLU move. ""The unrest in places like Baltimore and Ferguson are the natural consequences of white indifference to the plight of Black men,"" Obama asserted. ""Shut out of lucrative employment by racial discrimination Black men have no alternative but to resort to crime just to make a living. Taking the initiative to sell drugs or steal property puts them at risk of being shot by police. This perpetuates the racial injustices that have stained America's history.""

The President issued a call for ""a nationwide mobilization to reverse inequalities and redistribute the nation's wealth more fairly among all its people. If victims of injustice could have confidence that the government would redistribute wealth they would have no need to attempt an ad hoc redistribution through looting.""

Paul LePage.

2015-04-11,1428719917,"SEMI-NEWS/SEMI-SATIRE: April 12, 2015 Edition","Work Requirement Pares Maine Food Stamp Recipients

Enforcement of a work requirement by Republican Governor Paul LePage's administration has led to 9,000 former recipients being declared ineligible to receive food stamps. Under the work requirement, able-bodied food stamp recipients were asked to put in 20 hours of work per week or 24 hours of volunteer services per month.

State Rep. Scott Hamann (D-South Portland) called the work requirement ""inhumane"" and compared it to ""indentured servitude."" ""The Governor is taking the state out of the mainstream,"" Hamann argued. ""Other states have sought an exemption from the work requirement, but LePage is charting a course that sends a message telling people they must work in order to eat. In my view, this is a step backward.""

Maine Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Mary Mayhew defended the Governor's approach. ""Entrenching people in a life of dependency is not a way to get them out of poverty,"" Mayhew said. ""It's one thing for a person to be physically unable to support themselves. It is quite another for a person to refuse to contribute effort to sustaining himself.""

Hamann belittled ""the contention that self-reliance is an appropriate ethos for a modern society. Not everyone is equally endowed with a strong work ethic or the ambition to succeed. Some inherit laziness and stupidity through no fault of their own. We shouldn't be holding the losers in the genetic lottery to the same standards as the winners. Those who are lucky enough to be born energetic and ambitious have an obligation to society to help carry the weight of those less fortunate than themselves.""

In Kansas, a bill to ban welfare benefits from being spent on body piercings, massages, spas, tobacco, nail salons, lingerie, arcades, cruise ships or visits to psychics was denounced by state Rep. Carolyn Bridges (D-Wichta) as ""an unacceptable infringement on people's freedom to spend their own money as they see fit. As a society we have determined that these people are entitled to public support. By endeavoring to limit the uses to which they can apply thus support we are degrading their perception of self-worth and making them second class citizens. This is appalling. Freedom belongs to everyone. Poverty shouldn't be used to limit a person's choices.""

In stark contrast to what's going on in Maine and Kansas, the nearly bankrupt State of California is looking to make illegal aliens fully eligible for state welfare benefits. ""This nation was built by immigrants, how can we not cut them a piece of the pie?"" asked state Sen. Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens). Lara dismissed the state's budgetary deficit as ""an excuse, not a reason for excluding newcomers from enjoying the fruits of citizenship.""

Iranian Ayatollah Calls Obama ""Lying Devil""

Ayatollah Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, characterized US President Barack Obama's statements about the agreement negotiated between the two countries as ""deceptive"" and evidence of ""devilish"" intentions.

""Obama's assertion that Iran has agreed to ramp down its pursuit of nuclear weapons in exchange for a phasing out of economic sanctions is a lie,"" Khamenei said. ""What we have agreed to is this. First, all sanctions must be immediately ended. Once this happens we agree to refrain from engaging in any nuclear attacks until, in our judgment, circumstances for a favorable outcome warrant it. Most likely, circumstances won't be favorable for at least a few years.""

US Secretary of State John Kerry sought to minimize any perceived discrepancy between the two sides, saying that ""Khamenei's statement is within the bounds of the framework we've been constructing. We could quibble over which comes firstthe end of sanctions or Iran's self-constraint as a nuclear poweror we could make the first concession as a step toward building good will.""

""Right now, Iran is conceding that there will be at least a few years before they launch any nuclear strikes,"" Kerry pointed out. ""This should ensure that nothing drastic happens during President Obama's remaining term. After that it will be up to his successor to devise a strategy for dealing with Iran.""

In related news, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf dismissed warnings from former secretaries of state Henry Kissinger and George Schultz about the nuclear agreement the Obama Administration negotiated with Iran as ""lots of big words that few people will understand.""

Kissinger and Schultz noted that the so-called agreement lacks any provisions for enforcement. Neither does it address Iran's sponsorship of terrorisma behavior that will become a bigger problem once sanctions are lifted and Iran has more funds at hand to aid these groups.

Harf insisted that ""these concerns are irrelevant since Iran will not agree to inspections and reserves the sovereign right to use its resources as it deems best. For us to raise these issues would complicate the negotiations and make any agreement unlikely. We feel that it is better to have half a loaf than none.""

Administration Brushes Off Russian Hackers

Evidence that Russian computer hackers penetrated security at the White House and State Department was brushed aside by National Security Council spokesman Mark Stroh.

""Since the Administration has no hostile designs on Russia we don't consider their gaining access to confidential correspondence at the State Department or White House a threat to our security,"" Stroh maintained. ""In a way, this could be a good thing. They will see that we bear them no ill will. That could open up new avenues for better relations between our two countries.""

""It would be far more worrisome if our correspondence had been illicitly obtained by domestic right wing groups that have long harbored a racist resentment of the President and his transformative agenda,"" Stroh contended. ""These groups have been working assiduously to undermine the President from day-one. They even mounted an unsuccessful effort to oust him from office in 2012. The Russians haven't done anything as menacing as that for the whole time he's been in office.""

President Chastises ""Less than Loving"" Christians

President Obama took the occasion of Easter Sunday to chastise Christians for being ""less than loving."" ""Over the past few months alone we've seen so-called Christians refuse to take photographs and bake cakes for gay weddings,"" the President lamented. ""This directly contradict's Jesus' admonition to 'judge not lest ye be judged.'""

Obama rejected the idea that Christians might have legitimate religious objections to social policies with which they disagree. ""Jesus bade his followers to turn the other cheek if they are offended,"" he reminded. ""Jesus allowed himself to be crucified rather than fight back against those who wronged him. Shouldn't Christians be following this example?""

In related news, murders of Christians by Islamists in Kenya and elsewhere this month failed to elicit any comment from President Obama. Press Secretary Josh Earnest explained that ""the hundred or so students murdered in Kenya is but a small fraction of the 2.2 billion Christians in the world. So, in no way can Christians be considered a 'persecuted minority.' Besides, from a historical perspective, didn't Christian martyrs play a huge part in sparking the spread of Christian beliefs? Maybe these Islamist atrocities will help reinvigorate Christianity from its fading role in modern culture.""

In related news, Christiana Figueres, the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, called such massacres ""a clumsy and cruel, but nevertheless effective method toward achieving the necessary and essential goal of depopulating the planet.""

White House ""Gender Neutral"" Restroom ""Not Good Enough""

The Obama administration's efforts to earn gratitude from the gay lobby by adding a ""gender neutral"" restroom to the White House came up short.

Lesbian-Gay-Bisexual-Transgender spokesperson Irma Crank called the move ""not good enough. Every bathroom in every home in America is 'gender neutral.' Many businesses already have 'family restrooms' that can be used by either gender. The Administration's attempt to curry favor with such a lame and wishy-washy measure is an insult. Frankly, we expected more from this President.""

The ""more"" expected by Crank ""is the right of any person to use any facilitymen's room, ladies roombased on their sexual feelings of the moment. Herding individuals with uncertain or fluctuating sexual identities into a neutral space stigmatizes them. Anatomy must not be allowed to overrule a person's mental state. An anatomically male individual must have the right to explore his feminine side whenever the urge presents itself. Likewise, an anatomically female individual must be free to express her masculine side.""

Crank also denounced ""the dodge of one-occupant-at-a-time facilities that some businesses have been turning to. Urinating or defecating in a room by oneself stunts a person's feelings of solidarity with those whose sex he or she is striving to identify with. Obviously, we are not yet at the point of full gender identity freedom in this country. We will not be satisfied with halfway compromises. We need to keep up the pressure until everyone is free to go wherever he or she pleases.""

White House spokesman Jeff Tiller expressed his disappointment with ""Crank's hasty condemnation. I think we're all on the same page here. The gender neutral facility is for those who may be uncertain about their gender identity. Individuals who are sure may opt for the men's or ladies' room as they see fit. Beyond the White House, the Department of Justice will vigorously prosecute any businesses or organizations that try to restrict who may use whatever restroom facilities they provide.""

2014-11-21,1416583730,Guess Who's Coming To Dinner? And Guess Who's Picking Up The Tab?,"Last night, Emporer Obama granted a seat at the Great American Table to 5,000,000 illegal aliens. These are not ""undocumented immigrants"" any more than a cat burglar is an ""undocumented resident"". These people came into our country illegally. 

There is a protocol that people follow when they come to my house. They walk up to my door and ring the door bell. I answer the door. If I do not know them, I investigate a little before I invite them into my house. This is just good sense. Only after I have fully vetted someone are they allowed entry into my home. For some reason, the Obama administration thinks it's OK to let someone sneak into our homeland and stay because it's ""the humane thing to do"". This makes no sense at all to a person with a functioning brain. 

Now these 5,000,000 (and this is on the low side of any known estimates) are seated at the Great American Table ready to partake on the buffet that is America's social programs. Free education, free healthcare, free social services, etc. Let's look at the numbers, shall we?

In a study released this year by FAIR, Dan Stein calculated that the burden just to the State of California is $25,3000,000,000 per year which equates to a cost of $2370 per California household per year. This is an increase of over $4,700,000,000 from the same study released by FAIR in 2010. During this time, the United States has almost doubled to enrollment in the Food Stamp Program, or SNAP. Why is this? Well, it's easy to do when you fail to enforce the existing immigration laws and you ADVERTISE HOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AMERICA'S SOCIAL PROGRAMS IN MEXICO! 

In other developed countries, you have to prove your worth to society in order to be granted entry. Who is seated at our table? Unskilled workers are most likely to enter our country. There have been anecdotal reports that Mexico and some Central American governments are sending their prisoners to the US because it's cheaper than housing them there. These uninvited guests seated at our table are not the best and brightest people. They are at best a drag on our economy and not an asset to our country as His Majesty suggests. This is merely a pander for approval after he got his ass handed to him at the mid terms.

2014-03-30,1396215559,This is what gets deleted from the comments section on CNN.com,"I post comments occasionally on CNN.com news articles. I noticed that there is a definite liberal bias (yeah, we all knew that, right?). However, it didn't occur to me that they would REMOVE comments that had zero profanity, nothing racist - except I guess being against illegal immigration is racist. Like these:

-----

""The Democrats won't go after the illegal aliens. The school teachers and social workers refuse to, too. And they tend to vote Democratic.

""The Republicans won't go after the employers, landlords, and used car dealers. Employers and landlords and used car dealers tend to vote Republican.

""So we as a society are stuck providing free services (about $14,000 per year per illegal alien's child) and welfare of all kinds for displaced low skilled American workers and their families. No wonder our jobs situation is so hard and our governments borrow so much, and our kids suffer dilution of educational resources and quality instruction.""

-----

""Come to the U.S. Illegally, and pregnant, you qualify for prenatal care. Your child is eligible for Medicaid delivery ($5,000), food stamps, WIC, and then HeadStart pre-K, free K-12 education at $11,000 per year spent by the school district. So by graduation, the child has received over $132,000 in education spending, as well as free school lunch, free food stamps, free medical care. No amount of taxes the typical illegal alien parents pay will EVER cover the costs. No wonder these parents do it. Sure they work for low wages or pick vegetables or do grounds keeping. The farmer and they are not paying for the free services. WE PAY in higher property taxes, higher income taxes, higher sales taxes. This is unsustainabl. The ENTIRE amount of taxes collected from SEVERAL entire households are required to pay for just the education of ONE illegal alien's child. We already have half of Americans not paying much in taxes we can't afford an additional burden. Not to mention the illegal alien parents displace the American worker from her job, so she and her family ALSO goes on welfare, food stamps, free lunches, etc. and poverty and unemployment is linked to greater suffering, divorce, depression, suicide, at risk youth, higher rates of trouble with the law and incarceration. No wonder 40% of Black men and 38% of white men have been arrested at least once by the time they are 30, and unemployment in the construction and warehouse and low-skilled manufacturing sectors is so high for Americans. Copy this and share everywhere. The messenger is not important. The message is. If employers and landlords and car dealerships were only allowed to sell to citizens and legal residents, we would need no border enforcement. The border enforcement is just a ruse.""

-----

""So burglars and repeat shoplifters and identity theft criminals should also not go to jail if they have kids - is that how it works? It takes parents away from innocent kid, right? Gee...

""And I find it hard to believe that these illegal immigrants pays more in taxes to cover their costs to society. Florida spends $9,000 per student per year to provide a public school education. That's $18,000 per year. (If you factor K-12 education, that is $234,000 for the two kids over 13 years.

""Few American families ever pay that much in taxes combined at any level. The taxes of a dozen to two dozen middle class households are needed to cover just one child alone. There are only enough resources to provide adequate education for a certain number of kids before the quality gets diluted.
So if you ever wonder why property taxes and sales taxes are so high, and why school districts issue 30-year bonds to cover 5 years of expenses, and why our schools are crowded and teachers have a hard time teaching when kids don't share the same language or frame of reference, and why kids aren't learning as well and suffer high dropout rates, think about that.""",Conservative,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/21ryv3/this_is_what_gets_deleted_from_the_comments/

As a former Bernie supporter, some of these points may sway his supporters as well.

- Replaced the unfair, one sided NAFTA (which Biden voted for and Bernie didn't want) with USMCA

- USMCA created millions of manufacturing jobs

- Speaking of jobs, unemployment is at an all time low

- Wage discrepancy between genders, races, etc. is at an all time low

- Small businesses have had their best years yet

- Big businesses have followed that exact trend

- The stock markets have exploded with wealth

- Killed the current day Bin Laden in al-Baghdadi of ISIS

- Withdrew troops from Syria and Afghanistan, ending endless wars (Bernie wanted the same and Biden voted for the Iraq War)

- Established the Space Force; not only does this ensure the US military has an advantage in the future, but revitalizes Space R&amp;D with an extensive budget

- Increased American influence militarily through increased expenditure 

- By replacing unilateral trade agreements with bilateral ones, Trump has increased American negotiating power

- With his tax cuts, Trump has kickstarted a largely stagnant economy

- By using a carrot and stick approach, Trump has brought home offshoring American companies, providing an additional boost to the economy

- Punished China with a successful trade war, additionally decreasing Chinese influence as international confidence in the nation dwindles

- Tightened rules around immigration

- 3.9M Americans have been lifted off of food stamps

- The American consumer is as valuable as ever

- Spent the most out of any American government in history to fight the opioid epidemic ($6B+)

- Increased coal exports by 60%

- Negotiated a bilateral trade deal with the EU resulting in massive profit

2020-02-07,1581104979,How did you become conservative?,"Hey all.

Really interested to learn why/how you became a conservative. I've been fairly progressive my entire life, and have believed in things such as universal healthcare, anti-war/anti-interventionism, and constraining business so it doesn't step on the little guy, but also have tried to be open minded about other view points and perspectives in an attempt to better understand where people are coming from.

Lately, I have felt an internal struggle within myself, I see certain things around modern day liberalism in America that have made me question some of my beliefs, and indeed seem to go against values I hold. For instance, I really hate the fact that most of those on the left seem to make the individual out as ""helpless"" and needing government to step in and save the day. This robs people of agency and dignity in my opinion, and accepting this narrative is just such a negative mode to operate from (""woe is me, the game is rigged, I'm never going to get ahead"") mentality is what I'm referring to.

It strikes at the heart of my beliefs, because of my own personal experiences, and is also why I'm a bit torn. I come from a pretty poor family in a poor community in rural Kansas. My family relied on food stamps and government assistance, so I definitely see the value in those programs, because of the help it provided my family, but also in years since then I've grown up, put myself through college with scholarships and loan, graduated, continued to self-educate and worked my way up into a successful software development career and this of course, I was able to do because of my own hard work, dedication, responsibility etc. and it just seems my current political mindset seems to discount these aspects so much and it is really discouraging.

TL;DR

My own personal experiences have shaped me as a liberal/progressive but more recent experiences have me rethinking certain aspects of my own personal political ideology. How/why did you become a conservative, what aspects of your life informed your own political ideology. Really curious to hear from you all.",Conservative,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/f0frt8/how_did_you_become_conservative/

2019-04-08,1554726364,My issues with the American Left.,"* **The hatred.**  Far too many Leftists hate Conservatives as people.  Simply mention a Conservative position and they attack you personally.  Immigration, Voter ID, food stamps, taxes, religious freedom, Israel, education, jobs = Racist, elderly-hating, poor-hating, rich loving, homophobic, islamaphobic, religious nutjob, corporate pawn.  In my opinion, when you accuse people of things like that without basis, you're not a good person.
  
* **The assumption that if you oppose the method of achieving a goal then you oppose the goal itself.**  If we say; ""Hey, I don't think this is the way to fix health care...""  The most common reply is; ""You just hate poor people and want them to die in the street!""  That's ridiculous, of course we want to help the poor, of course we want to improve health care, we share many of the same goals we simply have different approaches.
  
* **The complete misunderstanding of Conservative positions with no honest attempt to learn about the positions.**  95% of Liberals cannot accurately articulate any Conservative positions and the logic behind the position.  Guess what?  There are reasons we have the positions we have, they might even agree with them, and if they fully understood them it would at least make finding common ground a lot easier.  We generally know the Liberal positions and the reasons for the Liberal positions, they are unavoidable with today's media.
  
* **The spending.**  The country cannot afford it, the excessive spending has to be stopped.  It's a ticking time-bomb that is going to make the last recession look like the good ol' days.  It's not fair to our kids and grandkids, and yes, we actually *do* care about that.  We know that Bush also spent too much in his last two years, there's a reason his popularity fell to 25%, we hated it when he did it too.  I do not believe that the Left is sincere in their complaints about deficit spending.  Based on their multiple new multi-trillion dollar spending proposals they clearly don't see deficits and national debt as issues at all, regardless of the amount.  The Left seems to think that sharing the blame is a solution.  It is not a solution.  It's a deflection, a game of whataboutism.  
  
* **The judging of laws by the intent of the law instead of the real world impact of the law.**  Banning ""assault weapons"" will do nothing to stop gun violence.  Banning large soda containers will not solve the obesity problem.  Making people dependent on Government will not help them move up into the middle class.  Throwing more money at 50-year-old unsuccessful programs will not solve the education problems in poor neighborhoods.  Attacking corporations will not create jobs.  We need to identify root causes and address them head on.

2019-03-16,1552744156,A rant about voting age,"When I was young and dumb I was once a stupid r/libtard full of optimism and hope, this glorious world around me was bountiful and ripe with splendour, there was no evil, there was no sadness, only spectacular opportunity. 

Then I got my first paycheck after working 40 hours and almost half of that was gone to the mystical and the mysterious government who would be using the fruits of my labor for the benefit of society... Ok, there's a lot of people out there that need this more than I do and I'm helping them. 

I was working for a lawyer who owned some rental property, I cut the grass and I did the manual labor necessary to keep the lawns nice and the lights working, I was helping people with everything I did. 

Then I started working in healthcare... I started as an EMT-B back in 1999 and we covered an entire city with primary 911 coverage because the bureaucracy failed and the fire department was insolvent after years of unfunded pension liabilities. Those who worked for years and paid into the union were left without any retirement or healthcare coverage, the lies of the ponzi scheme became obvious when the city lost ""revenue"" (tax money) when residents fled the blight for better jobs in better places. Enter the private market... The privately owned business which was beholden to those same taxpayers and Medicare and Medicaid paid 30% of the bill rate for services. 

I began to realize that the community was full of downtrodden and non contributing people, we were taking patients to doctors appointments because they were so unhealthy they couldn't walk. They were living in subsided housing, collecting 100% disability, getting food stamps which have no restriction on what's purchased, and calling us to take then to a doctor who's getting 30% bill rate for services and we're getting 30% bill rate for services provided by all those tax dollars they're taking from my paycheck.... 

Now, these individuals were on complete disability for absurd reasons like morbid obesity, mental issues related to stress, alcohol addiction, drug addiction, etc. But my paycheck was getting taxes taken out and giving the alcoholic the money to go down to the local bar and drink, my paycheck was giving the morbidity obesity patients the free will to go to the local grocer and buy whatever pop, candy, snacks, and unhealthy food they wished. Why? Why am I contributing to this viscous circle?

Then I woke up, I realized that the democrat party wants slaves.

The Trump administration has offered a proposed rule that, if implemented, would make it less likely for foreign citizens who access welfare to receive a green card.

The proposed rule is published and open for public comment. So far, open-borders advocates have flooded the federal register with their comments in opposition to the proposal. Please leave your comment by clicking here:

[https://www.regulations.gov/comment?D=USCIS-2010-0012-0001](https://www.regulations.gov/comment?D=USCIS-2010-0012-0001)

Here are some suggested talking points you can include in your comment:

* **Express support for the public charge rule!**
* Welfare use among immigrant households is already high. A recent report from the Center for Immigration Studies found that 63% of non-citizen households, approximately 4.6 million, use welfare.
* The Migration Policy Institute confirms this finding. According to its research, 47.2% of non-citizens receive at least one type of the four major public benefits -- cash assistance, SSI, food stamps, and Medicaid/CHIP.
* The average immigrant household costs U.S. taxpayers $6,234 each year in federal welfare benefits.

**ABOUT THE 'PUBLIC CHARGE' RULE**

The administration's proposed rule simply strengthens the already existing rule that defines what welfare programs USCIS can consider in determining if a green card applicant is likely to become a public charge.

The existing rule is limited to cash assistance and institutionalization for long-term care. The [proposed rule](http://hub.numbersusa.com/route/8/5c0579bf74e18a7c11ae6e81/1721505/9?D=USCIS-2010-0012-0001) would include food stamps, public housing, and Medicaid, among other programs.

New analysis of government data from the Center for Immigration Studies finds that 63% of non-citizen headed households access some form of welfare. You can read more about their findings by [clicking here](http://hub.numbersusa.com/route/9/5c0579bf74e18a7c11ae6e81/1721505/9).

2018-07-28,1532796610,The Problem With Capitalism?,"My responce to someone in this subreddit  who claimed we don't understand socialists.

&gt;A lot of them want a piece of the capitalist pie and have been screwed over. By dismissing them you are making them indignant and giving them further ammo.

Capitalists create the pie, socialists think they deserve to be the pie makers just because they are educated and work hard. Sorry, everyone already enjoys a piece of the capitalist pie, they consume it every day.

&gt;**1. People with education and degrees are struggling to find relevant work.**

That's the problem, they pissed away opportunities to discover relevant work. They were sold the lie of ""follow your passiins, do what you love. So they end up with worthless degrees in saturated markets with overpriced educations.

&gt;A lot of them put a ton of work into university, got a degree and did everything right. But struggle finding a job in their field because the job requirements for even entry level jobs typically require years of experience. Ive seen entry level jobs that require five years of experience. When you see enough of that you become demoralized that you did everything right only to end up with a job as a waitress. Are some of over privileged and think there should be no hardship? Maybe. But that doesnt change the fact that its often much, much harder to find a job in your field these days even if you have the required education.

That's because they didn't do everything right. No surprise that socialists believe in some form of the labor theory for value. Work hard, do everything right, expect to get paid a living wage AND pay off insane debts. Like someone who didn't go to college who thinks that you should get paid to dig holes and fill them back up, after all they worked hard to do it, they should be rewarded for it.

&gt;**2. Bosses and companies that guilt trip you into overworking.**

These are the same bosses that understand that if you you walk away or quit, there will be somone else to replace you because despite your complaints, your wages and benefits are pretty damn good all things considered. That's why one persons overworking is another person's work ethic and drive to succeed. 

&gt;What made me socialist wasnt college. It was working my first job out of college. We were paid above minimum wage and yet guilt tripped into working 12-14 hour days. Some 60 year old woman would work from 5 in the morning to 9-10 at night every day and it still wasnt enough for our bosses. And even if you worked an 8 shift theyd be like,why cant you be more like her? Essentially, we have a situation where many jobs want you to give your lives to them. Sometimes while working for peanuts. Dont assume that they dont work hard. Many of the socialists I know work two jobs. They are trying the best they can. They just dont beleive in the system at all anymore.

My 57 year old mom works circles around illegal immigrants in a factory, making 13 bucks and hour after 30 years. You know why she does it? Because she is a hard worker and that's just part of who she is. She is the one literally kicking coworkers in the ass when they are slacking or pretending they don't understand English and playing grab ass with female coworkers.

&gt;**3. A lot of them have to make the choice between going to the hospital and just letting something heal on its own.**

Welcome to life, it's rough at times and yet the vast majority of Americans have first world problems and often choose to waste money on things they don't need and end up foregoing things they do need. That doesn't means that people don't suffer out of no fault of their own. But let's be real, the average poor American lies like a king relative to 50% of the world's population.

&gt;Medical expenses are so high that they outright dont want to go to the hospital even if it could be life saving. Because the last time they went to the ER they got a thousand dollars worth of charges for being there for two hours. Related, they see big pharma hike life saving medicine to ridiculous prices and get away with it. As seen in that insulin price hike a few years back.

And that has nothing to do with capitalism. Every single country with socialized medicine that isn't a shithole like Cuba is capitalist. 

&gt;**4. They feel the country values corporations above the common man**

The common man owes their first world problems to capitalists and evil corporations are just a means to attack capitalism and pander to the common leftist/victim.

&gt;This is self explanatory. When a company like Amazon is predicted to become the first trillionaire company while the employees have to live on food stamps, this pisses them off even further.

This is why I can't stand socialists or their natural progression when they realize socialism fails (Democratic Socialists) Do you honestly believe that the average Amazon employee HAS to live on food stamps? Or what about the average worker that benefits from Amazon. Do you think delivery drivers make 10 bucks an hour? What about businesses that are able to expand their services thanks to products they can have shipped to them with expedited shipping?Hundreds of companies sell products on Amazon, they pay employees that don't need to be on food stamps. Get out of here with corporations out people on food stamps, it's bullshit. 

&gt;**5. The 2008 financial crisis.**

What does that have to do with capitalism? Without capitalism you have famine crisis and disease crisis. Instead of people losing homes they lose family members.

&gt;Arguably the biggest influence for the most modern rise of socialism. Bankers committed fraud that caused the Great Recession and Obama pardoned them. This told an entire generation that elites are more important than them. It is one of single handed most disasterous decisions of his presidency.

I agree. 

&gt;**6. After eight years of conservative media calling Obama a socialist the word has been desensitized.**

No it hasn't, that's why socialists have turned to buzz words like Democratic Socialism to take off the edge and pretend that socialism can work if only it becomes part of Democratic institutions.

&gt;Good work, Fox. The over use of the word last presidency made young people look into, and later, consider socialism. If everything if socialism, nothing is socialism. And if nothing is socialism then socialism shouldnt be feared. And if its not feared it will be treated as a good thing because its an easy sell.

That's nonsense.

&gt;**What you should notice is that a lot of them have commonalities with conservatives who voted for Trump. A lot of us agree theres a problem but we have disagreements on how to fix it.**

The only thing we have in common is that we understand that the government screws up nearly everything it touches. Socialist sypathizers seem to think that we just have the wrong people in power, that if we overthrow the evil corporations and replace them with benevolent politicians we can fix the ""problem"" of greed and inequality. 

&gt;A lot of them furiously believed in the American Dream but dont see how its possible. They no longer believe in any institution of America therefore they believe it should be remade. Multiple things have contributed to this and it is a dangerous position for the country to be in. They overwhelmingly beleive that the country has been taken over by elites who deem them common serfs. And whether you agree or not, a lot of Trump supporters agreed that there was at least a problem. That many average every day Americans were being left out for greed which is precisely why Trump promised to drain the swamp.

Yes. The problem is that the elites, whether politicians or heads of corporations that serve as proganda arms for the government have been selling out the country. Getting in the way of prosperity by expanding government and making people dependent on it while advocating for open borders and refugees that will only make the problem worse. 

&gt;So because we have many commonalities and agree that many Americans werent getting their fake shake, we should try to make our best case for why capitalism works and socialism doesnt as humanely and empathetically as possible. We must win them to our side.

The best case for capitalism reveals itself when the government gets out of the way and people are able to afford an education and are able to find jobs that allow them to live a life within their means. People who are busy working, raising families, providing for themselves and loved ones don't have time to bitch about capiatalism.

&gt;We must stress that while capitalism has excesses, that socialism in its largest, purest forms takes away individual freedom and values. Lets be clear, I am not for pure capitalism just like Im not for pure socialism a capitalist society needs *some* social programs and workers rights or else were just slaves that get paid. We must admit that we are having monopolies dictate American life. As conservatives we must be the first to admit theres a problem there when a literal monopoly on video sharing services, YouTube, can dictate what is and isnt okay to be on their site. With them censoring conservative views on YouTube you got to admit that this is attempt of elites trying to control the conversation, that its a corporation being placed above Americans. This is the exact thing socialists are against.

You sound like a Democratic Socialist. Which is a call for socialism without eliminating capitalism. Which means it's not socialism, it's just more big government.

&gt;We must emphasize that we arent entirely enemies and show them the merits of capitalism while also disagreeing with any abuse of human welfare under it. By doing that, I believe we can win. But if we plug our ears and pretend theres no problem and theyre just deluded, selfish, people Its ours to lose. Because more and more people see socialism as a good thing. We must fight this with a clenched fist and take it **very** seriously.

There are plenty of problems. Capitalism isn't one of them.",Conservative,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/92nj89/the_problem_with_capitalism/

You see, if I take $20 bucks from you, and then give it back to you later - that's not a gift (or entitlement).  It's YOUR money I'm giving back to you (hopefully with some deserved interest).

Problem is, language matters.  If people keep referring to something in a particular way, it sticks (like a Band-Aid - *see what I did there?*).  Language is important.

It's also important to NOT to lump Social Security in with other government programs which are (in fact) ***handouts!***  Damnit.  It's MY money I want back.... not yours... not the governments.  MY money.  I earned, the government took it (presumably for safe keeping), with the promise of returning it to me when I'm old.  It's NOT an entitlement.  It was an involuntary (forced) savings program that no one has the option of opting out of.

2018-04-26,1524778921,A response to some of the problems in Bernie Sanders job guarantee proposal,"I was going through my YouTube feed earlier and saw this video \( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS3toephRDM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS3toephRDM) \) from Kyle Kulinski of secular talk who is a big Bernie supporter and progressive talking about how great this new proposal being put forward to give everyone who wants a job in America a job.  I figured you folks might enjoy the comment I left :D

/ / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /

So this proposal is full of gaping problems that Kyle didn't address, I'll just list a few of them here along with the reasons they are problems.  Before you freak out and start screaming right winger, I'm not, I'm a centre left person who used to be a communist, who used to be a socialist and who used to be a massive Bernie supporter.  I'm not anymore and that's why I know this plan is terrible, because 2\-3 years I would have agreed with it and I was a bad person then.  I really hope you take the time to read what I've written and really think about it.

The number 1 problem, which is the most glaring, they have no idea how much this will cost and if they do they aren't saying because they know it's ridiculous.  I thought Ted Cruz actually put it very well in one of the debates he had with Bernie on healthcare when he said that his universal healthcare proposal would cost 13 trillion dollars \(On the low end of estimates, but at that point it doesn't really matter if its 13 or 30 trillion\) and that even if Bernie taxed every single millionaire and billionaire at 100&amp;#37; he wouldn't pay for that and those people wouldn't have any money to tax the next year.  This is a key problem with people like Bernie Sanders who run around saying America is the richest nation in the world \(as it's 20trillion in debt\) and acting like America can afford to pay for any social program he wants it to.  The fact is America is the wealthiest nation on earth because its citizens have lots of money, not its government, and that wealth does not belong to the government, it belongs to those citizens.  Sorry to break it to you.  This is one thing the corporate and regressive democrats agree on, they have a right to citizens money.  Just look at how they treat tax cuts, socialists act like the government taking less of peoples money is stealing because they can't redistribute that wealth to the people who vote for them.  Take a second and really think about that.

My second  problem is not so much with the proposal itself but with the way Kyle is defending the simple question of how much is it gonna cost and who is gonna pay for it.  The whataboutism progressives \(and conservatives to be fair\) are constantly engaged in when it comes to government spending is actually very grating for anyone who isn't a partisan hack.  Just because neocons set trillions of dollars on fire in the desert and some hypocrites did hypocritical shit in response doesn't give you a blank cheque to spend on whatever bullshit will make you feel good.  This is the go to excuse for progressives when someone asks them ""How are you gonna pay for that"" they reeeee ""Well the bush neo\-cons wasted trillions in Iraq"".  that's not an argument, that's a deflection.  Was the Iraq war dumb, sure it was, that doesn't make this proposal any less dumb \(and expensive, but I'll put that math below\)

Just doing some quick maths that I'll lay out here so you can do it on your own, there are 6.6 million people who were unemployed in march 2018 \(4.1&amp;#37;\), and say you pay each one of them 15$ an hour for 8 hours a weekday with 2 weeks paid vacation, it comes to around 30,000$ a year, then you add on health benefits which generally costs the government about 10,000$ a year in the socialist republic of Canada \(say 7,000$ American just to be conservative in these estimates\) 37,000$ in compensation times 6.6 million unemployed equals 224 billion, 200 million dollars per year in just wages and benefits for these programs, not even taking account the infrastructure spending itself.  However then you have to take into account the number of people making less than the sum total of these benefits, Kyle and TYT used to always go off about how half of Americans make less than 30,000$ a year, remember that?  How many of those people do you think have benefits?  I'm guessing not a lot.  That means as many as half of the American work force could see this plan as an improvement, in which case why wouldn't they do the rational thing and sign on.  If even half of them did there would be 56.6milion people registering for this program.  In other words take that 224.2 billion number and turn it into 2.094 trillion dollars a year in wages and benefits.

Take another second and ask yourself why it is that I can do that math with 4 google searches and my phones calculator, yet a sitting US senators staff can't figure this out to tell a newspaper?  Could it be because if Bernie were president and implemented this not only would it gut the American economy, probably irreversibly, but it would also cost the government a little over 8.3 trillion dollars per term.  I think he and everyone else would only have to worry about 1 term at that point though.

I'm sure some of you are now thinking, ""but how could employing people gut the economy, that's the whole point of the economy, to employ people."" well you're half correct if you are thinking that.  The point of an economy is to facilitate trade and commerce in order to generate capital for investment in things that will create more trade and commerce for entrepreneurial people, the fact that people have to be employed in that is only a positive side effect.  The key rule of economics is supply and demand, the lower the supply the higher the demand, and this is true for labour as well, the left understands this, but they dont know how to properly apply this concept.  I could get into the hypocrisy of the lefts stance on illegal immigration, including Bernie sanders flip flop from railing against the Koch brothers on the issue to siding with them after being pressured by Latino advocacy groups in the primaries, but I'll focus on the issue that is more at play here \(giving the benefit of the doubt that this program would only be available to US citizens\) which is automation.  If the government artificially lowers unemployment and provides a job at above minimum wage, what is the private sector going to do?  Just look at the current fight for 15$ nonsense progressives are engaged in, is a company going to compete with a federal government that just gave 15$ an hour wages and health benefits when it is looking for a check out clerk or is it going to automate?  Is a fast food place going to hire some teenager who wants to work part time while going to school at 15$ an hour or are they going to automate \(youth unemployment in America is 4 times the national average btw\) If this program were implemented companies would immediately double or even triple the speed of automation, people would be locked into working for 15$ an hour and benefits for the government because there be no place for the vast majority of low skilled labour in the private market.  That isn't even to get into how this would effect small business's in rural areas who frankly probably can't afford to compete with the compensation the government would be offering, but hey, the big cities are 2/3 of the GDP, those are the places that matter according to Hillary.

Another little side note, I really enjoyed how Kyle describes the progressive view of the Overton window, ""we'll come in with something crazy and stupid, and then in a few years we'll say something even crazier and more idiotic and it'll make the first thing seem reasonable"" this is hilarious on two fronts, the first is apparently Kyle has been reading the art of the deal and the second is this mindset validates every slippery slope argument made against progressives.  Gun control went from maybe we need background checks to repeal the second amendment \(Thanks justice stevens for that gem\) for instance.

The important thing to do with a proposal like this is to take it to its logical conclusion.  Approx. 50million people lets say on the governments payroll, probably still needing food stamps and other such benefits, doing low skilled infrastructure work for the government like painting schools, picking up litter, filling potholes etc.  Oh and I know you were probably imagining crews of people with shovels and picks building roads and dams and what not, but that's the problem with this new deal nostalgia, it's not 1940 anymore and 20&amp;#37; of the population isn't considered to be unemployed.  Roads aren't built by huge teams of people with shovels, they are built with heavy machinery operated by people trained to do so.  Think about the last time you drove by municipal road work, how many people did you see leaning on their shovels drinking coffee?   How many people with shovels are you willing to see your federal government pay with your money to fill in potholes and pick up litter in Kansas?  Take a second and really think about what is being proposed here and what the consequences will be beyond just the feel good, the govt is gonna take care of people stuff.  This would more than double the size of government in low skilled workers, not even counting the massive bureaucracy that would be required for logistics.

Schools Struggle with Religious Intolerance

Contrasting styles of how to cope with differing religions in schools were demonstrated recently in Massachusetts and Germany.

In Massachusetts librarians at Simmons College in Boston issued The Anti-Oppression Library Guide to promote equality and limit religious persecution. The Guide urges students to ""refrain from using trigger words like 'Merry Christmas' or 'God bless you' after someone sneezes because these words constitute microaggressions against Muslims. Muslims don't celebrate Christmas. And the notion that God should bless a non-Muslim is offensive to their faith.""

The Guide warns that ""even unintentional or inadvertent use of such trigger words could unleash a violent response that Muslims would regard as fully justified. As far as Islam is concerned, unbelievers are subhumans who must submit to Muslim dominance or face extermination. It is best that confrontations on these matters be avoided if at all possible.""

In contrast, in the Peter Petersen Elementary School in Neukölln, Germany the Muslim majority students routinely bully non-Muslim classmates for insulting Islam by eating non-halal food like ham sandwiches or Gummy Bears or for being Jewish. School principal Hildegard Greif-Gross complains that ""the rights of native Germans are being abused by these ungrateful immigrants. We are giving them an education that far surpasses what was available to them in the countries they emigrated from. Rather than appreciating what we are doing for them they are importing the barbaric ways of the countries they left behind.""

Local Imam Mulhed Ashat condemned the principal's complaint, calling it ""an insult to Islam. Kafirs have no right to criticize any Muslim for any reason. Allah gave all the world to his believers. Her life is forfeit to the first righteous Muslim who chooses to slay her.""

In related news, more Democrat voters in America believe Muslims are treated worse here (56%) than Christians are treated in Islamic countries (47%). This is despite substantial evidence of violent crimes committed against Christians in Muslim countries during 2017, including 3,066 killed, 1,252 abducted, and 1,020 raped or sexually harassed, and 793 churches attacked or destroyed. Almost all of these crimes were carried out by ""moderate"" Muslims, not Islamic terrorists. In contrast, the assaults against Muslims in the United States has averaged 50 per year over the past two decades. A possible explanation for Democrats' mistaken beliefs is likely the discrepancy in media coverage. Muslims in the US have been granted ""victim"" status by the media. Crimes against Christians in Muslim countries have been mostly ignored.

Conn Guv Says NRA a ""Terrorist Organization""

Connecticut's Gov. Dannel Malloy (D) called the NRA ""a terrorist organization"" and announced his state will ""boycott the NRA.""

""Their defense of gun ownership goes far beyond legitimate protection of the rights of hunters and ventures into explicitly anti-government intent,"" Malloy argued. ""In their fantastical vision, citizens need guns to be able to fight against tyranny. If that isn't an out-and-out threat to authority I don't know what is.""

""Citizens owning guns may have made sense when we were fighting the British for our independence,"" Malloy ventured. ""But times have changed. Under our democracy, the government is the people. It is nonsensical that citizens would any longer need guns to protect themselves from government oppression.""

""Ideally, only the government should have guns,"" Malloy contended. ""The next best option would be for the government to extend the privilege to select individuals or groups whose loyalty to the government is without question. These loyal citizens would constitute the 'well-regulated militia' that government officials could call upon to put down rebellions against its authorityas the writers of the Second Amendment originally intended.""

Senator Says ""California Represents the Future""

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif) vehemently denounced US Attorney General Jeff Sessions' efforts to enforce federal immigration laws, calling them ""a grievous and doomed attempt to thwart history. California represents the future toward which America is inexorably marching.""

""As Gov. Brown so eloquently pointed out, the so-called evils that Sessions claims to be trying to prevent are part of a worldwide evolution toward the more natural way of life being experienced outside of the United States.,"" Harris maintained. ""The notion that Americans can live above the standards that exist in other parts of the world is both selfish and unsustainable. Owning a home with indoor plumbing, heating, and electricity is a luxury that can only be allowed for a small elite. The sooner we reconcile ourselves to this reality, the sooner we will stem the necessity of people migrating here in hopes of a better life.""

Harris admitted that ""the average American may be ill-suited to adapt to this emerging return to a more natural state of existence. Our saving grace, though, is that under our state's open-borders agenda the vast majority of those entering the country from Latin America and the Middle East are ideally suited to this life style. So, there is a replacement population that is flowing into the country of its own free will. And I am proud to stand with visionaries like Gov. Brown and Mayor Schaaf who are working diligently to accelerate this transformation.""

Part of Schaaf's diligent work included warning illegals in her city of the recent ICE raid. This enabled an estimated 800 to escape apprehension. Of the 232 caught by ICE, 115 (~50%) had prior felony convictions for serious offenses, such as child sex crimes, weapons charges and assault, or had past convictions for significant or multiple misdemeanors. ""While the 50% proportion of common criminals among the immigrants rounded up by ICE seems high, let's not forget that we force these people into the criminal classes by making them sneak into the country,"" Schaaf reminded. ""If we welcomed them in and gave them apartments, food stamps and other amenities unavailable in their home countries they would have less reason to prey upon our citizens. So, I blame Trump, Sessions, and the other racists who would deny these people their human right to live wherever they choose.""

Planned Trump-Kim Meeting Irks Soros

Billionaire donor to the Democratic Party George Soros is apoplectic over the announcement that President Trump has agreed to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un within the next two months to discuss nuclear disarmament of his country.

""This never should have happened,"" Soros complained. ""I paid $30 million to defeat Trump in the 2016 election. I've funded street protests and riots to try to undermine his administration. I've been working tirelessly with the FBI and media to generate a scandal that will drive him from office. That this Korean twit would wreck my efforts by yielding to Trump's pressures and threats is yet another unexpected setback.""

""We were so close,"" Soros lamented. ""The aid provided to Kim by Presidents Clinton and Obama helped North Korea attain nuclear power status. While North Korea could never conquer the United States, the possibility that Kim could've nuked Guam or maybe landed a missile within the US borders should have paralyzed any rational US leader. Trump's maniacal and unfair threat to annihilate North Korea for any attack changed the course of history for the worse. It's beginning to look like our only hope is for the US intelligence community to take Trump out like they took out JFK after he vowed to dismantle the CIA.""

Dem Promises Reparations by 2020

Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif) promised an audience in Selma, Alabama that ""we will provide reparations for slavery to all African-Americans by 2020 if we take back the House this November. We are going to divert those billion dollar tax cuts Trump gave to corporations and white people and pay off every Black man, woman, and child in America, except for 'Uncle Toms' like Ben Carson.""

Waters brushed aside difficulties in trying to distinguish between whites who owned slaves and the millions of white soldiers who fought in the Civil War that ended slavery in this country. ""It's not about guilt or liability,"" she clarified. ""It's about racial equality. Those whites who died to free the slaves still had it better than the slaves did. Today's whites have it better than Blacks. Equality demands that this disparity be eliminated.""

To help drive home her point, Waters targeted fellow legislator House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's $90 million in personal assets as ""a pot of money we will be looking to redistribute among African-American members of congress. Lord knows I love Nancy like a sister, but she's got to do her sisterly duty by me and the other members of the Black Caucus. Poor old Charlie Rangel wouldn't have had to cheat on his taxes if he could've had a share of Nancy's stash. It's a simple matter of social justice.""

For her part, Pelosi pronounced Waters' intention ""noble of heart, but impractical in reality. Those of us in government have got to stick together rather than fight among ourselves over the few crumbs in my bank account. The Federal Reserve can print more than enough money for every descendant of a former slave to get a generous payout. There is no need for her to covet my money. My ability to hold my seat in congress and to campaign for equality is founded on the leisure provided by the income I obtain from my investments. Surely Maxine wouldn't want to take that away from me.""

Waters tried to reassure Pelosi that ""we're not going to take it all. When you and I are evened out is when we'll stop redistributing your wealth and move on to the next person in line.""

2018-01-27,1517023888,"SEMI-NEWS/SEMI-SATIRE: January 28, 2018 Edition","Dems Reject President's DACA Proposal

The Trump proposal to extend a path to citizenship for 1.8 illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children was assailed by key Democrats this week.

Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill) called the proposal ""far short of anything I could agree to. What about the other 30 million undocumented persons living in this country? Where's the path to citizenship for them. On top of this, Trump's 'deal' would require us to agree to fund beefed up border security, limit chain migration, and end the visa lotteryblocking millions of future migrants from enjoying the same opportunity that he would selfishly restrict to a relatively few 'worthy' dreamers.""

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) denounced Trump's proposal as ""a cynical ploy to place the interests of current citizens ahead of those hoping to become future citizens. He's asking Democrats to accept a mere 1.8 million new voters as the price of us consenting to block 30 million or more new voters. This is far short of 'half-a-loaf.' Polls show that the majority of Americans are with us on this issue. We will use Trump's insulting proposal to win the 2018 elections, take back congress and advance the progress pf our efforts to oust the usurper.""

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif) labeled Trump's proposal ""heartless. His plan is to give preference to the competent and productive among the dreamers when it is the incompetent and unproductive who are most in need of the benefits we can afford to provide. The welfare programs south of the border are pitifully inadequate. Trump would target those who seek the better life they can live under the generosity of our government for deportation. This is unconstitutionally both cruel and unusual punishment for the tens of millions who have endured the severe hardships of trekking across the border.""

In related news, beginning April 1, illegal immigrants who have been granted driver's licenses in California will be allowed to vote. ""It's the next logical step in our state's battle against the Trump Administration's attempt to close our borders to immigrants,"" said Gov. Jerry Brown. ""The votes of these immigrants will ensure that the state will send Democrats to Congress to oppose Trump in 2018 and ensure that our electoral votes will go to Democrats from this point on.""

House Intel Memo Sparks Reaction

A confidential memo written by Republicans from the House Intelligence Committee has sparked different reactions from Democrats and Republicans. Republicans who have read the memo describe its contents as ""shocking.""

""The facts contained in this memo are jaw-dropping and demand full transparency,"" said Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla). ""The widespread illegal surveillance of America citizens by the nation's intelligence community for what appear to be purely political motives is not the kind of behavior one expects in a free society. We need to release the memo so the American people have information they need to decide how they want their government to be run.""

Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va) acknowledged that he has not read the memo, but described it as ""sloppy, careless and has no grounding in fact. How do I know this? Well, for one, it was written by Republicans. For two, it alleges that members of the FBI would misuse their authority in a biased way to favor one Party over another.""

Unfortunately for Democrats, contents of some of the 50,000 text messages between FBI agent Peter Strzok and FBI attorney Lisa Page discuss a plan to ""go easy"" on presidential candidate Hillary Clinton because, as Page pointed out ""she might be our next president. If we get on her bad side it could wreck our careers.""

Strzok replied that he ""agreed"" and said he contacted his FBI superior Bill Priestap, ""who also agrees with our perception."" Strzok later revised then FBI Director James Comey's draft letter on the Clinton ""matter"" to change the description of her handling of classified emails from the legally culpable ""gross negligence"" to the vaguer, but safer ""extremely careless."" All of this took place months before 17 witnesses and Clinton herself were even interviewed.

Warner professed himself ""unmoved by these text exchanges. Considering that everyone was sure that Hillary would be the next president, it's understandable that they wouldn't want to rub her the wrong way. Putting their 'thumbs on the scale,' so to speak, would be a natural survival reflex in those circumstances.""

Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) disagreed with his senate colleague's ""casual attitude toward this serious breach of ethics by those high up in this country's foremost law enforcement agency. Justice requires the unbiased consideration of evidence. The decision to grant leniency to someone on the premise that the person is powerful is corrupt and conducive to tyranny. It cannot be allowed if we are to remain a free country.""

Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, adamantly opposes letting the general public see the memo because ""they don't have the necessary knowledge or experience to adequately understand the seemingly inappropriate steps the intelligence community must take to defend the country from enemies both foreign and domestic. It is naive to think that a federal agent should remain unbiased when the very fate of the nation may require that 'dirty deeds' be done to save it.""

Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), ranking member on the House Committee on the Judiciary, demanded that ""the FBI be allowed to review the memo and correct any inaccuracies or take whatever other action it deems necessary to protect itself before it is released. Let's not forget that the FBI has been protecting this country since the Dillinger days. We shouldn't allow the squeamishness of a few Republicans about the FBI's methods to undermine public confidence in this great law enforcement agency.""

In related news, a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Court ruling found that 85% of the National Security Administration's (NSA) searches of individual American citizens during the Obama Administration violated the Constitution's Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches. In response, the NSA has deleted ""honesty"" and ""openness"" from its ""core values"" statement on its web page.

Three States to Sue over New Tax Law

New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that his state, New Jersey and Connecticut will be suing the federal government because ""the new tax law impedes our ability to extract the maximum amount of revenue from the taxpayers."" The impediment comes from the clause in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that limits the deductibility of state and local taxes to a mere $10,000 per taxpayer per year.

The three states rank at the top of the list for heaviest tax burden as a percent of income with New York at 12.7%, Connecticut at 12.6% and New Jersey at 12.2%. The states also rank high in terms of household median income. But hey, isn't having the rich pay more in taxes the constant refrain of Democratic politicians whenever the issue is brought up?

Cuomo maintains that ""the state tax burden had been partially offset by the old federal tax code that allowed for lower tax states to pay a larger share of the federal tax burden than they otherwise would have. This was fair because these other states have lower state tax burdens, and thus, more money available to send to the federal government. Suddenly changing the rules like Congress and President Trump did was unfair. Our states have grown dependent on being able to shift the burden. Cutting us off is like throwing a family off of food stamps or out of public housing. It's an intolerable shock to the system.""

Aside from the lawsuit, Cuomo says his state is considering switching from an income tax to a payroll tax. ""First, payroll taxes are deductible from federal taxes,"" he pointed out. ""Second, this will give a break to the high-income donors from Wall Street who donate the majority of the funds state Democrats receive for their election campaigns.""

In related news, California Assembly Majority Leader Ian Calderon (D-Whittier) has introduced a bill that would subject waiters who give customers a drinking straw without being asked to a fine of up to $1,000 per straw, up to six months in prison, or both. ""Plastic straws have been raping our environment for far too long,"" Calderone claims. ""Waiters are in a position to ameliorate this degradation if they take a more active role in deterring the over use of these weapons of mass desecration. My bill will provide a little more incentive for them to act more aggressively and responsibly.""

Baboons Escape from Paris Zoo

A contingent of 52 baboons is reported to have escaped from the Paris Zoo. The animals are said to be ""large and potentially very aggressive."" Authorities are reportedly uncertain about how this situation should be handled.

""On the one hand, there is concern that innocent civilians could be harmed by the animals or our efforts to try to recapture them,"" zoo manager Jean Pomfrite worried. ""On the other, there is some speculation that the streets would be safer if they are overrun by simians than Sunnis.""

Florence Parly, Minister of the French Armed Forces, is said to be assembling a team to work on the terms of surrender. ""As we learned from some of our nation's previous encounters with hostile forces, it is better to prepare for peace than attempt to fight a battle we are unlikely to win,"" Parly maintained. ""We're confident that if things get really bad the United States can be counted on to come to our rescue. While others have often mocked us, I'd like to point out that our cost-effective approach has worked for France for more than 75 yearssaving us money that has been better spent on wine, bread and cigarettes.""

NAACP Disputes Trump's S***hole Description of Haiti

This week, NAACP spokesperson Secreta Stool sought to disprove President Trump's characterization of Haiti as a ""s***hole country.""

""Statistics show otherwise,"" Stool asserted. ""Only 40% of the population has no access to indoor toilets. This means a majority use flush toilets. Among those unfortunates without indoor plumbing most just relieve themselves in the street, not a hole. So, a more accurate description of Haiti is that it is a cesspit of poverty, disease, and violence.""

Stool said the NAACP has filed a defamation suit against the President. ""He has slandered and demoralized the people of this noble nation,"" he said. ""We are seeking immediate entry into the United States and free accommodation at a Trump hotel for every Haitian fleeing the country. Alternatively, the United States government can pay damages in the amount of $50 trillion.""

CNN Panel Credits Obama for Booming Economy

In the midst of widespread praise of President Trump's economic policies by world business leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, a Cable News Network (CNN) panel mostly insisted that the credit for America's booming economy properly belongs to former President Obama.

CNN International host Christiane Amanpour asserted that ""most of the people I talk to on a regular basis agree that President Obama is really the one responsible. It was his policy that ushered in the period of sacrifice and stagnation that made Trump's moves toward deregulation and tax cuts possible. Let's not forget that the eight years preceding Trump's inauguration were the only presidential term in US history where economic growth never reached 3% for a single year. This laid the groundwork for the current surge.""

CNN's Chief White House Correspondent Jim Acosta echoed Amanpour's remarks, saying that ""Trump is merely lucky to be in the right place at the right time. If it hadn't been for the efforts President Obama made to suppress excessive economic growth the impacts of Trump's policies would've been much more modest. Right now, the corporate fat cats are pleased, but whether any of the benefits trickle down to average folks remains to be seen.""

""That's right,"" CNN's Early Start host and Chief Business Correspondent Christine Romans chimed in. ""The top 1% are benefiting immensely. Smaller benefits are being realized by the middle classa thousand dollar bonus here, a few thousand in tax cuts per household there. Everyone is getting richer, but the gains aren't equal. People on welfare aren't getting bonuses or tax cuts. Whether an unequal prosperity is better than the more equally shared sacrifice that President Obama tried to make the new norm is an open question.""

The sole member of the seven-person panel willing to give Trump any credit was Steven Moore, Distinguished Visiting Fellow, Project for Economic Growth, at The Heritage Foundation. ""There can be no doubt that the Obama Administration's policies discouraged investment and growth,"" Moore observed. ""But to claim that these policies deserve the credit for the current surge in business investment and confidence is absurd. It's like saying that Obama's previous policy of placing the government's foot on the neck of the US economy merits more praise than Trump's moves to dislodge it. That is twisted and insane.""

Meanwhile, the count of companies awarding bonuses to employees because of the Trump tax cuts has now reached 250. Home Depot and Starbucks were the most recent firms to announce that their hourly employees would be sharing in the companies' good fortune due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

This week, retired singer Barbra Streisand took to Twitter to vent against the recently passed tax cuts saying that ""blue states, athletes, actors, writers, producers, and directors will be punished by this scam of a tax bill. It targets those of us who have earned millions entertaining America. It limits property tax deductions to only a single residence and caps it at $10,000 per year. I, myself, have several homes. I don't remember exactly how many, but all of them are in the multimillion dollar range and have annual tax bills far in excess of $10,000.""

""What Trump fails to understand is that my fans want me to have the millions I've acquired through my talent,"" Streisand asserted. ""Changing the law to make me pay more in taxes is an injustice. The rich that ought to be targeted are those who gained their fortunes by the crass merchandising of daily necessities like food, fuel, and housingthe kind of things government should be providing gratis to everyone. Hard-working actors and singers who had to claw their way up to where they could charge $10 million to make a movie or $150 per seat at a concert are the elite of the working class and deserve to be better treated by our laws.""

Streisand said she reneged on her August 2016 promise to leave the country if Trump won the election because ""traveling is just too hard. I know I could probably avoid the nasty impacts of the tax changes if I moved to another country. Checks for my millions in royalties and returns on my investments could be mailed to me, but I feel I owe it to my fans who can't escape to stay and, on their behalf, harangue Congress until they impeach the President.""

It seems likely that Streisand will become even more unglued when she catches wind of longtime adviser to Hillary Clinton Philippe Reines' publicly announced fear that ""millennials might become Republican if they notice they don't have to pay as much taxes. This could be a devastating blow to Democrats who need to keep these voters focused on the outrage of diverting money away from government and into the hands of those who earned it.""

In related news, California Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin de León (D-LA) has introduced a bill that would allow wealthy taxpayers to evade the new federal tax law by redefining payments to the State government as ""donations."" The gist of the plan is to establish what he calls ""the California Excellence Slush Fund. Payments to this Fund would be available to the government for whatever uses we deem fit. For example, this money could be spent to defend California's sanctuary status against the invasion of federal authorities seeking to deport people it says are in the country illegally.""

Gore Says Bitter Cold Confirms Global Warming

Former Vice-President Al Gore confidently brushed aside the possibility that this past week's bitter cold across much of North America might indicate that the global warming he has profitably been hyping for the last 15+ years could be mistaken.

""The theory of global warming, or climate crisis that I now like to call it, postulates that any change in the weather merely confirms the global warming hypothesis,"" Gore declared. ""The most important action anyone can take at this time is to continue to buy copies of my books and movies explaining how it all fits together.""

Meanwhile, observations of solar output show a pattern of decreasing heat reaching Earth from the sun. Many climate scientists are predicting that a global cooling trend for the next several decades seems more likely than a continuation of the warming trend Gore has been warning must be addressed by massive government regulations aimed at ""lowering the excessively indulgent lifestyles enjoyed by Americans."" Strangely, despite railing against the general public's bad behavior, Gore's own lifestyle is far more indulgent than that of average American consumers who possess neither energy-guzzling palatial estates nor their own personal jet aircraft.

In another holier-than-thou incident, England's Prince William urged commoners ""to reduce the number of children they bear in order to save the Earth from an excess of surplus population."" That the Prince's wife is currently pregnant with their third child has led some to call the Prince a hypocrite. The Prince rebuffed the accusation by pointing out that ""my children are assured the means to have fruitful and meaningful lives. The same cannot be said for the common run of mankind who must despoil the planet just to make a living.""

Former FBI Director Leaked Classified Memos

In July of 2016, FBI Director James Comey chastised Democratic presidential candidate for her ""extremely careless handling of classified emails."" It now appears that Comey himself may have been ""extremely careless"" when he leaked classified memos to a friend with instructions that they be subsequently leaked to the media in the hope that it would lead to the appointment of his friend Robert Mueller as Special Counsel.

This week, David Hardy, Chief FOIA Officer of the FBI, made out a sworn statement that ""all of Director Comey's memos were classified when they were written and remain classified to this day. For someone as well-informed as the Director to distribute these memos to a person or persons lacking the proper security clearance would constitute gross negligence and disregard of the statutes controlling who has legal access to such information.""

Ironically, an earlier draft of Comey's July 2016 chastisement cited Mrs. Clinton's criminal ""gross negligence"" in her handling of classified material sent through unsecured channels to her private off-site computer, a number of which ended up in the possession of convicted ""sexter"" former Congressman Anthony Weiner. Previously, Mrs. Clinton has said that she asked her aide Huma Abedin, who is married to Weiner, to send her emailssome of which were classifiedto her home computer so they could be printed out. Last month, Abedin's cousin Omar Amanat was convicted of financial fraud. Previously, Amanat was involved in a $300 million real estate project with Vladislav Doronin, a man referred to in the British press as the ""Russian Donald Trump.""

Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif) called this recent turn of events ""extremely frightening. Technically, Comey may have broken the law by sharing classified info with the media, but he was in a tough spot. A man who the FBI did its utmost to try to prevent being elected president was his boss when he leaked those memos. I believe he was trying to save the nation from a grievous error committed by voters who were duped by Russian propaganda into to turning against Secretary Clinton. I feel more strongly than ever that we have to oust Trump and get someone in there who will pardon Comey and those other patriots who tried to save the nation from falling into the hands of this madman.""

In related news, James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence during the Obama Administration, called President Trump's complaints about the FBI spying on his campaign and manufacturing false ""evidence"" aimed at undermining his Administration ""reprehensible and disturbing. While the agency's actions may not have strictly adhered to the law, there can be no question that their intentions were honorable. As they saw it, Trump threatened everything they fought for during their years in government. At worst, they are guilty of justifiable intervention in an attempt to save the country from a madman.""

Dire Economic News Heartens Dems 2018 Election Hopes

A trio of recently released economic statistics have boosted Democratic hopes of retaking the majority in the House and Senate later this year. First, in December, private employers increased payrolls by stepping up hiring and reducing layoffs. Second, unemployment among blacks fell to the lowest level since 1972. Third, the number of Americans on food stamps fell by two million.

Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez labeled these statistics ""the starkest of warnings concerning the sad fate in store for average Americans under Republican government. Millions are being forced out of the social safety net so meticulously constructed for them by the Democratic Party and into the harsh world of imposed self-sufficiency. In just one year alone two million Americans have been bumped from the food stamp program. Instead of having the government put food on their tables these poor souls will now have to do it themselves.""

""We are especially concerned about the racist implications of herding more blacks into the labor force,"" Perez said. ""This return to the type of slavery to which blacks were subjugated prior to the Civil War is a barbarous reversal of the freedoms Democrats extended under the Great Society welfare programs initiated when Lyndon Johnson was president.

""As tough as these policies may be on our base over the next ten months, they bode well for our chances of prevailing in November,"" Perez continued. ""If we can successfully portray the election as a choice between labor vs. leisure we believe we can muster a majority of voters to reject the changes the GOP is foisting on our constituents. Admittedly, motivating a base that has already rejected effort as their responsibility seems daunting.

""We need to boost government spending on social benefits to ensure that a person's choice to take a job is not due to the duress of needing money to support herself and her children. The option to work or not work must be free from any form of coercion. Only generous and unconditional entitlements can do that.""

Cars Burned to Celebrate New Year

In France, burning cars on New Year's Eve is becoming more popular. This year's toll of 1,031 vehicles torched, predominately by Muslims residing in the country, topped last year's 935. French Sociologist Michel Wieviorka maintains that we should consider these arsonists as ""playful rather than criminal in nature. The vandals are mostly young men of foreign heritage coming from countries where automobiles are rare. On the one hand, there is a genuine and warranted expression of rage at a society in which cars are available to some, but not all. They are hitting out at the injustice of a system that distributes these vehicles based on the ability to pay for them.""

""On the other hand, setting vehicles on fire and running away seems like great fun,"" Wieviorka observed. ""And the risk of arrest is minimal. Burning cars are such a normal event on New Year's Eve now that police shrug them off. For example, last year, when more than 900 bars were set ablaze the Interior Ministry reported that the New Year's celebrations had gone off 'without incident.' Rather than get ourselves worked up over it, we should adapt to the cultural enrichment these immigrants are bringing to France.""

Meanwhile, a fire at the Chappaqua home of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is reported to have destroyed all of the personal emails from her tour of duty at the State Department. A heartbroken Mrs. Clinton expressed regrets that ""my decision to delete these precious memories from the official files I turned over when I left now means that there is no way to recover the correspondence leading up to my daughter's wedding or the heart-felt chats I had with my yoga buddies and Clinton Foundation donors.""

2017-03-16,1489697157,"If charity is insufficient to feed the poor, what is your next move?","This is a common and simple but enlightening libertarian conundrum.

Is it really stealing if a poor person steals a loaf of bread to feed their starving family? 

The vast majority of libertarians would say YES! That goes without saying. ""Statists"" believe that we collectively and proportionately redistribute wealth to fund social programs such as food stamps in order to feed poor people who cant temporarily find work. Whether some libertarians call that theft or not is irrelevant to statists, since statists couldnt give two shits about rich people or libertarians being inconvenienced by taxes  were trying to concretely feed poor people whom the marketplace has failed.

As a retort, libertarians argue that charity would solve this issue. But what if it doesnt? What if charity isnt sufficient? Then we have three outcomes:

* OPTION 1:  The poor person steals a loaf of bread (perhaps violently) in order to feed their family

* OPTION 2: The government collectively uses taxes to feed the poor (not even the equivalent of scraps taken from the wealthy)

* OPTION 3:  Or the poor family starves to death

Option one is a desperate act that could lead to violent harm or death to the poor person, or the person who is being robbed. The theft itself could be of another poor person who cant afford to have their loaf of bread stolen and cant afford proper protection unlike the rich (ie, not proportionate redistribution of wealth). Option two is a safer version that is civilized and steals from a broad-base of people and takes most from those who have the most capacity to give (ie the wealthy). Option 3 the poor family simply starves to death. From my knowledge, most libertarians have no issue with poor people starving to death if charity isnt sufficient since lowering and eliminating taxes is more important, but I digress&

Modern civilization has unanimously picked option two. Its not even close.

2017-02-10,1486739166,"If charity or the ""free market"" doesn't work, libertarians have NO answer","I suppose I'm going to use this post to get to the crux of the issue I have with libertarians. I often see libertarians being challenged on a number of issues, but these two stick out in my mind:

1) welfare, food stamps, disability and safety nets ect.

2) civil rights act and anti-discrimination laws

These are my favorite ones to bring up because libertarians are so vehemently against these things, and their positions are so astoundingly problematic.

As a defense mechanism, libertarians always claim that either charity or the free market will solve these problems that would occur with the removal of these things. 

For example, libertarians actually believe CHARITY is a legitimate and viable alternative to modern day welfare programs. That is absolutely insane to most thinking people, but this is what libertarians actually believe. I could go on and on how this is not only wholly unrealistic but historically inaccurate, but I'm not interested in that.

In a second example, libertarians actually believe that the ""free market"" will fix all discrimination issues involving race and other oppressed minorities. They actually think discriminated minorities wouldn't face unfair positions in the market place. I would highly debate this, but again I'm not interested in that.

**What I AM interested in, is pointing out the large elephant in the room -- in both of these points, if charity or the magical ""free market"" is insufficient in solving these issues, then libertarians believe nothing else should be done.**  This is very very very important to understand, especially for new and young libertarians who might think they are joining a righteous cause.

For example, if a poor family cannot earn a living wage in the libertarian ""free market"" -- **and if charity is not enough to feed their family** -- then that family starves to death. End of story.

If a single father can't afford cancer treatment for his child, and charity isn't sufficient -- then that child dies. End of story. 

If a black family can't find affordable or safe housing and food in their neighborhood, because no one rents to them and no one sells them food -- and no viable free market competition sprouts up to serve them -- then that family either must relocate potentially hundreds of miles away, or face homelessness or starve. End of story. 

This is indisputable. This is what several libertarians are ok with. Stop the sugar-coating about fairytales regarding charity and ""free market"" competition -- in libertarian nightmare land, there is no solution for these problems. **If charity or the market isn't sufficient, people will suffer.** END OF STORY. 

Now, I can already guess the typical response:  ""Libertarians don't promise solutions! We promise liberty!"" This is fine, but you need to start being honest with yourself --  you are advocating policy that, at the end of the day, thinks the government should not attempt to solve any of these problems, **and you are ok if people starve and suffer because of that.**

2016-12-28,1482950383,"If there were no taxes, why do libertarians assume people would have more net-income?","Pretty simple. This basic assumption, of which there are several among libertarians, is perhaps my most baffling that I time and time again come across.

If we lived in a ""stateless"" society or a ""mini-anarchist"" society that had little to no taxes, why is there an assumption that an average human being would have so much more additional income?

For example:

**1) Why wouldn't every person's additional income not be going towards all the services that were previously supplied by the state?** For example: military (absurdly expensive), police, fire-department, prisons, courts, food (farming subsidies), roads, bridges, regulatory agencies (now private subscription services) and several other state services that I'm probably forgetting and that we probably all take for granted. These will now all cost MONEY. This is money of course that has value because it is backed by the US Government and is used to pay taxes, but I won't even get into that. Some of these services will likely be expensive, or at best poor people will only be able to afford lower quality replacement services, unlike the wealthy who will be able to afford premium services, like top-notch police and military protection. This of course goes on top of all the current costs of living, like rent and health-care, which people are already struggling to afford. I imagine millions of poor people wouldn't be able to afford many of these services, since tons of poor people constantly barely or are unable to afford current essentials, and that's **despite** being supplied government welfare assistance. We'll have to assume that state-funded safety nets will of course be gone, because we all know how evil food-stamps for children are. So yeah, aren't you guys forgetting that your tax dollars are actually PAYING for things? Your tax dollars do not just disappear. 

**2)  Why would employers pay you your current wage if taxes were removed?** Why wouldn't they decrease your wage to the value you previously were netting after taxes? After-all, your employer **knows** that your previous after-tax income is what you agreed to before. It's the income that you were ""living"" on and ""happy"" with. Now that taxes are out of the picture, why on earth would your employer let you keep that additional money? There is no incentive. The employer can make more profit and there is little fear of you leaving since others can and will take your place. 

**Bonus question:**   If we even made the faulty assumption that everyone would have more income without taxes, then why on earth is the assumption that the additional income would be pooled into charities and that it would be sufficient in replacing the now extinct government services for the poor? Why are libertarians hoping and praying that everyone will use their additional income to donate to charity? Why are you guys relying on such an absurdity? If you think that will happen, demonstrate why it would or GTFO.

Millions of working families rely on food stamps to feed their children. The SNAP program has literally lifted them above the poverty line since the ""free"" market has been insufficient to do so. This has created a freer existence for these families, since their constant existence isn't tied to the existential threat of starvation and homelessness, which would be the case for many without the food stamps which literally feed people. Yes, people.  Human beings. 

As libertarians, a group of people that claim to want to maximize liberty for all people (not just the wealthy ruling class, remember), how do you propose to sell these families on the idea of cutting benefits which literally provide them food?

Remember, the people who use food stamps are actually human beings that, despite working jobs, still need these benefits to have adequate food. My guess is these people don't give a fuck if libertarians are inconvenienced with taxes. You know why? Because without food stamps their lives could potentially be literally at stake!

2016-01-29,1454087955,I've been kicking around an idea: let individuals lend imaginary money to the government instead of the fed doing so.,"Before I begin, I need to make a disclaimer.  This idea undermines capitalism.  However, lets remember that libertarianism is about individual liberty and non-aggression.  Usually, these principles lead to capitalism, but there is no reason they have to.  I don't mean this to start a debate on the definition of libertarianism.  At least, I'm hoping such discussion would occur within the context of this idea.  Also, keep in mind that most economists don't believe the national debt is particularly problematic in a practical sense; as far as its morality, I will address that.  Further I'm not saying this idea is perfect.  I'm saying it might be significantly better than the current system.  It still involves some degree of theft and coercion, though I think much less so than what currently exists.

It's pretty simple.  Currently, the select few imagine money into existence and then lend it to the government.  What if *everybody* got to do this?  People could lend imaginary money to the government and then either keep this debt and collect interest or sell it if they choose.  (Interesting question: could a person lend against this debt and collect interest twice?  It's wealth they own, and the government being a stable source of repayment, it is very secure on that end.  I believe this is essentially what the banks do now.)

This would allow social security to be phased out.  (I say ""phased out"" because there is no fair way to end social security.)  People could use any of this debt they've saved, interest they collect, and the sales of new debt they lend to supplement their retirement accounts.  In other words, there is less money being forced out of people's pockets.  

This also creates a de facto minimum income that is not entirely subsidy.  This could end the food stamp program.  How is it not entirely subsidy?  The government is comprised equally of each citizen.  People would literally be lending money to themselves.  However, no more money would be created than what is currently.

There are a couple problems that I see.

The first is that it still requires a large amount of government control.  In this scenario, there is likely no practical way for a person to negotiate the terms of this loan.  The interest rate etc. would probably need to be set by the government.  The government would have to set the amount of money to be created which would indebt people to a degree to which they might not agree.  (Remember, that debt is owed equally by every citizen.)  It could end up being used in a rather Keynesian way by increasing and decreasing interest rates and loan amounts, however, I'm not entirely sure doing so would infringe massively on liberties.

The second problem is that there is a paradox here.  By creating this debt, of course, money is devalued.  Therefore, this creates a subsidy in that the more money one has the more one loses.  However, if one with more money is allowed to create and lend more, the debt is owed evenly by everybody despite that amount of debt being created unevenly.  In other words, the rich would be forcing the poor to owe more money than the poor would to the rich.  The answer here might be a compromise, likely consisting of a floor, ceiling, and tiered system for the amount of money one could lend.

I don't know.  It's just an idea I've been kicking around.  I know it isn't perfect, it seems very counter-intuitive, but best I can tell it seems better than our current system.  I'm guessing somebody will figure out how it's more coercive than I've realized.  (Also, I'm no economist, and I'm sure there are many who would have plenty negative to say.)  I'm trying to figure out how this idea clashes significantly with individual liberty or how it's particularly aggressive, but I just don't see it.",Libertarian,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/439rga/ive_been_kicking_around_an_idea_let_individuals/
2015-12-06,1449434653,Do most libertarians really believe people are only poor because they are lazy and make bad choices?,"I'm not saying there aren't people who are unsuccessful for those reasons, poverty can be caused by a plethora of things. But I often hear this from libertarians to justify not having any financial assistance programs.

Do libertarians really think there is no such thing as racial or gender bias, or that being physically attractive and neurotypical has zero positive effect on your success? Or do they simply accept that such biases do exist, but shouldn't be corrected because it would be against liberty? 

I know private charity exists and all, but it was never adequate for caring for the disadvantaged and if anything is *less* efficient than government aid when you consider how many charities scam people and enrich themselves. Government aid programs are inefficient only because the taxpayers want them to be hyper-vigilant about ""detecting fraud"", which ironically wastes way more tax money than whatever tiny amount is being cheated out of the system and makes going back to work and getting out of the system a lot more risky. If charity was enough we would have never created programs like food stamps, SSI, and WIC. 

People tend to have enough problems of their own and not really care for the plight of strangers beyond some degree of tokenism.

So again, I think lazy people definitely exist, but not all of them are poor or unsuccessful. You'd be amazed at the people who never collect a welfare dime in their lives, yet can go their whole lives mooching off others and sucking at their job because they're pretty, charming, or downright dishonest and be damn prosperous doing it.

I agree with many of the aims Libertarians reach for, but the meme that people in poverty are just stupid or lazy/selfish is so silly it discredits the other great ideas Libertarians have. I can see how someone could believe taxes are inherently immoral, but most libertarians themselves don't seem wholly convinced of this being justification enough on its own so they tell themselves that the poor are bad people anyway and don't deserve aid.

2014-07-01,1404189531,Which libertarian ideas can be implemented through policy?,"Things like abolishing the minimum wage and getting rid of programs like food stamps and welfare aren't going to happen so easily. So many people rely on these programs (for worse). Therefore they will vote politicians to keep them funded. It seems like the best way to do this is do it at a state and local level.

What about privatizing things that the government owns? In Colorado, a part of an important stretch of highway was privately contracted for a few years because the voters voted down a tax increase (both wins IMO). Drivers that can afford the toll will use it, which will keep decrease congestion of the free lanes. The companies would take better care of roads because we're funding it with our tolls. What about privatizing some parks or forests? Some companies can charge small entry fees, while others are free to use the resources and sell them. This helps the US economy since now we are relying more on ourselves for resources than foreigners. We're in control of our own destiny.

What about eliminating overtime hours locally (not sure if this is possible)? It would allow businesses to provide more hours for workers. Any worker that wants to work more than 40 hours week can freely do so while anyone else doesn't have to. Then certain workers wouldn't have to get a second job because then they will just work 50-60 hours at one job.

There's a lot that can be eliminated or reduced that we don't really need. Things that just increase the cost for businesses, which means that ultimately we the people pay for since the costs are passed to us. Food inspection and nutritional facts cost businesses a lot (testing, labeling, etc.). Vehicle requirements make automobiles so expensive. The US relies a lot on personal automobiles and this can help the poor and middle-class immensely by lowering vehicle prices which would let them get better jobs and opportunities.

2014-02-03,1391436207,[Discussion] What does /r/Libertarian think about automation?,"Came across an interesting article in /r/news today that talked about people currently employed requiring food stamps to survive, and came across this comment:

""The cause of this is no surprise. The drive towards mechanization and automation in industry (along with outsourcing to a lesser degree) has eliminated the low-skill to semi-skilled jobs in this country which used to be the stepping-stones to a better life. My issue has always been that while we are always quick to adopt new technologies into our lives, very little thought is put into what impact that technology will have once integrated into culture. Clearly it is great for a business to buy a machine that can do the job that previously took 100 people, however, what will happen to those 100 people? Of course the intention was that destroying these tedious menial jobs would liberate us and give us all more free time to do the things we want to do. However, people cannot do the things they want in life without some form of job or income.
With this being the trend, reliance on food-stamps and supplemental programs will only increase, being that most of these low-paying jobs are very much not the stepping-stone style jobs of yesteryear, but merely the remnants of what a robot can't do yet, or is too expensive for a robot to do. But rest assured, when emotional appeal by workers to government to raise the minimum wage passes, automating these last few jobs with robots will seem very attractive to industry, and thus, the last of these jobs will disappear as well.
So, what will the future hold in this regard? If we continue the way we are going, there needs to be some reorganization of our society of what work is, what a job is, what a productive existence is. How does one get income in a 'post-job' world? Clearly we are heading towards a future where people are not necessary or irrelevant to the functioning economy. Businesses are booming, but no one is being hired. They don't need to hire anyone. So, what do we do? Design some sort of living wage? Do we all live off of government hand-outs? Maybe we devolve technologically to a point where we are relevant again? Do we just let it all collapse and start over from the smoking charred remains? I don't know, but we gotta think of something before we all fall over the edge.
Edit: grammar""



He brings up a very legitimate question. If we do raise the minimum wage, this will undoubtedly inspire companies to innovate and replace human labor with computers/robots at an even more accelerated pace.

2014-01-29,1391030188,A Short Response to the State of the Union,"In watching the State of Union I feel that I may have found one of the most fundamental issues in discussing politics in America: the definition by freedom.

If you go to Google and search the word ""freedom"" this definition appears: ""the power or right to act, speak, or think as one wants without hindrance or restraint.""

I would say that this a fairly accurate representation of what I believe that freedom really is. In his State of the Union last night, President Obama seemed to have a different take on what freedom is:

""And we will continue to work with the international community to usher in the future the Syrian people deserve -- a future free of dictatorship, terror and fear.""

""... to forge greater cooperation, to expand new markets, to free people from fear and want.""

""But for more than two hundred years, we have put those things aside and placed our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress: to create and build and expand the possibilities of individual achievement; to free other nations from tyranny and fear;""

And in searching for those examples I found that each time that Obama used the word ""fear"" it was preceded by the word ""free"".

While many might think that this is of little importance or perhaps an anomaly, I think it is something much bigger. I think that many Americans have whether consciously or unconsciously have come to define freedom as ""government provided security"".

The people on the left want ""freedom"" via welfare and food stamps; the security of know that they will be taken care of, while the right branch advocates ""freedom"" as keeping military bases across the globe. I'll get back to this in a minute.

I have recently began listening to Ron Paul's weekly podcast and in one episode he talked about how many of his supporters ask him how to get in to politics and make real change. Ron said that often he tells these young men and women that the greatest change they can make is by not becoming part of the game but spreading information and educating others about liberty and freedom.

Now let me tie this all together: Today in America, there is a fundamental division in what each American defines as freedom. When bickering with people, whether on the internet or person, you will often find yourself talk about freedom. I implore you realize that this word has a much different meaning to these people than it has to you or I. And so today I ask you: start changing people's minds about what it means to be free. Freedom is not knowing that you will be given welfare and food stamps if you don't have a job. It is cutting taxes by putting an end to these programs so that there is more money in our economy to create jobs. Freedom is NOT creating an empire with bases in across the globe. It is cutting military spending and reducing our debt.

2013-12-14,1386997275,Yesterday I posted a link to the Libertarian Party for MN donation page where you can get a $50 refund from the state for your party donation (PCR). This is why I deleted that post.,"I was surprised at the mixed response initially... but after thinking about it some more, and having a conversation with someone on a subreddit who disagreed with me (not just disagreed... pretty much hated libertarianism from the start), and then having a conversation about that conversation with a libertarian friend... I've changed my mind. I do not agree with getting reimbursed for a political party donation any longer.

The argument in favor was generally this; if you pay taxes, any way that you can get that money back from the government is a good thing, and an even better thing if it goes towards the libertarian cause.

Another, less popular argument for it was that if this is available to all parties, then it's only fair that it's available for libertarians too.

And then the almost non-existent argument was mine. My argument was that I know it is hypocritical of libertarians to use state money to move their party forward, but sometimes a small sacrifice in principle is necessary if it paves way to the greater good.

As I look back on those words of mine... words I wrote about two hours ago... I cringe.

What happens when the libertarian party finally becomes accepted, is finally respected, and then someone says ""But what about that government money you took in 2013? You totally took it. You're a hypocrite."" Credibility lost.

And I said to my friend ""Yes, but no party doesn't make small sacrifices. There is compromise in politics all the time.""

Compromise and sacrificing principle are two very different things.

The entire reason I became a libertarian was because I believed my principles were just and worth fighting for. The entire reason I became a libertarian is because I believe in the individual, I believe in personal freedoms. I believe that the government interferes too much and when it does, things become worse.

By accepting the PCR, we are allowing government to interfere because it is working in our favor. ""Use the PCR to demolish the PCR""... that statement was made and sounded good, but it just sounds like bullshit to me now. Because it is.

We don't need the government's help. The local Minnesota party is still taking it... which in retrospect is disappointing but there is really nothing anyone can do about it now. Maybe the local party is to blame, for not having the guts to say ""we will not accept this government handout"". Maybe I'm to blame. Maybe I saw an awesome opportunity to raise a lot of money for the party I love, and didn't even realize I was going against the very thing the party I love stands for! Then I posted it on reddit. Now I feel ashamed.

Anyways... agree or disagree with me, but I've changed my mind. I was planning on taking advantage of the PCR this weekend. I was going to donate my $50, and then fill out the form to be reimbursed. I am still going to donate the $50, but I'll be damned if I'm getting reimbursed from the government. I'm not trying to sound holier than thou, I just feel like it's my personal responsibility to say this and to also follow through by doing the right thing.

Anyways... there are a lot of haters out there and, as we all know, they have a lot of criticism of the libertarian party. This is one time, however, that the hater bested me. I can at least have pride in admitting my thinking was wrong, and hopefully many of you have my back.

So... I still encourage everyone to donate. We should all be donating frequently. Should we be taking that reimbursement check? I say no. Is there a difference between PCR and WIC, welfare, food stamps, etc? I thought there was... but if you think about it, there isn't.

Can we solve the problem by being a part of it?

My friend also said ""I never want my liberal sister finding out I took the PCR"". No shit, right?",Libertarian,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/1sukp4/yesterday_i_posted_a_link_to_the_libertarian/

2013-11-07,1383839562,Why I'm (at the moment) not a Libertarian,"Hey guys, before I start I want to make sure it's clear that I'm completely open to all ideas and only trying to bring my own points to light and maybe get a solid discussion going instead of the childish memes that have plagued the page recently.

I struggle with my own political views because I waver so much between my own views on the government. This is most likely the most I've really written/discussed the topic since I usually keep it to myself, I get the feeling that a lot of people stick to their guns on a topic or side and no discussion really ever takes place so it's tough for me to get a fair understanding on many issues because there is so much bias involved.

As my current views now stand, I'd probably consider myself a left-leaning libertarian but that might not even be the term and I'm sure you will correct me if I should be thrown in a different category. I am all for personal freedom when it comes to drug laws (I would be okay with pretty much all drugs legalized), gun laws (though I would be in favor of some pretty heavy background checks), I feel like religious institutions should be treated like other 501c3's to remove any favoritism by the government. I'm okay with media content rating systems but would oppose any sort of direct censorship. Pro-choice and all that fun stuff. War...I'd say I'm pretty anti-war but I can see cases where it could be the only forseeable option, but generally I'd prefer an approach where America is not focused on other countries affairs. Strongly opposed to the NSA stuff that's been getting out as well.

Now where I'm sure I'll be torn to shreds

I feel like safety nets and certain programs and services are a good thing. Like many government services, they need work...a lot of work but provide an overall benefit. I'm in favor of the health care reform act and even a public option health care plan. Are there issues with how it's setup of course but at the same time I feel like these are things we can tweak as a country over time. Instead if this were not passed because of those issues, it would take longer for any reform to happen if it does at all. I'm in favor of welfare, while I know it is taken advantage of it I can see how it is necessary for certain families to survive since I've been there. I was raised by my grandmother who was on specific government programs for food and other services. I was able to rise out of that environment and have no problem in paying the taxes which go to others in that situation. I could go over other separate points but I'll just jump straight to my main thought which will probably be destroyed soon:

Is this legislating morality?

Probably. But I feel at the end of the day, a person who is on disability checks, food stamps, or in need of a hospital visit doesn't care if the money they recieved from the kindness of someones heart, or someone forced to pay taxes. God damn it sounds awful, I know...I just put myself in the shoes of someone who is going through those hardships.

I think for me I see two outlooks the two viewpoints I'm torn between

* Ultimate freedom. Little to no taxes, the rich continue to live a good life and can make more money due to the fewer regulations and tax issues in place. Middle class is in pretty good hands until something happens (job loss, health issues, you name it)...lower class I'm not even sure...

* My ideal view is one in which I could be born as any type of person (poor, rich, disabled, black, white) and not be suffering or in extreme poverty. I'm not aiming towards socialism, I might not even be aiming to change what we have now, maybe tweak our current safety nets and systems to make sure the money is spent better and are going to the people who really need it but again I still feel we need many in place.

Perhaps this made my viewpoint clear, or perhaps it was the ramblings of a 'bleeding heart liberal'. I probably won't get a chance to respond much until later in the day but wanted to make sure I posted this because I truly am curious on everyone's views here and I want to see where I'm failing in my own viewpoints.

It's also not a synonym for a liberal that doesn't like the current administration and Congress.","I've noticed that this subreddit has become the red-headed stepchild of /r/conservative as more people have subscribed here. A lot of Republicans and conservatives have migrated over since the 2012 election and it has definitely shown in the past few months.

Here's [one post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/1ogxf4/food_stamps_in_red_states_by_county/) that really shouldn't be here and clearly deserves to be in /r/conservative. Come on guys. I thought we were beyond the Red Team vs. Blue Team charades? Apparently not.

There's a reason why the [introduction package](http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/1l1lzm/introduction_package_for_libertarianism/) to libertarianism thread was stickied (and it probably should be still stickied, but that's just me). It's to help introduce people to libertarian concepts such as self-ownership, the non-aggression principle, etc. The introduction package is meant for Republicans and conservatives to shed the Limbaugh/Hannity/Levin/Coulter rhetoric they tend to have and slowly but surely embrace Mises/Rothbard/Bastiat/Friedman. (I know I'd rather read Man, Economy, and State, Human Action, and The Law over Godless and Ameritopia any day of the week!)

I don't care if the media likes to use ""libertarian"" to equate Republicans as being crazy minarchists/constitutionalists. Don't believe the fearmongering. Contrary what the media likes to tell you, libertarian does NOT mean Republican. At all. Neither Republicans nor Democrats are our friends. Both parties have stabbed libertarians in the back over and over again the past 12-13 years by seducing libertarians into supporting the parties with the issues they agree with. (for example, Democrats saying ""vote for us libertarians! We're good on civil liberties!"" or Republicans saying ""Vote for us libertarians! We're fiscally responsible just like you!"") This is why people such as myself have had enough of both major parties.

And to all you liberals reading this: don't think you're off the hook either. Just because you hate the NSA and needless military intervention doesn't mean you're a libertarian either. Like conservatives, you share *some* ideas libertarians support, but that doesn't classify you as being an actual libertarian.

[This post right here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/1nn9dh/the_double_facepalm_is_reserved_for_a_special/cck8aw9) is a perfect example of the above situation.

Moral and philosophical dilemma","I'm thinking of going back to school, and my girlfriend is trying to convince me to sign up for financial aid.  I've never taken any money from the government.  I've been eligible for food stamps, but never considered signing up.

I consider the programs rather morally wrong, in that it's forcibly taking money from one person and giving it to another.  By using them, I'd be perpetuating it and saying it's okay.

My girlfriend's counter arguments are

1.  I pay taxes, I've paid taxes for years and will pay much more after getting a better degree and a much higher paying job.

2. She has paid a lot in taxes, and would rather I get the money than someone else.

3. The price of school is so damn high because of constant government meddling, so it's only reasonable to take their money to help compensate.

The third one is the most convincing to me, though I can see some merit in the other two as well.

i'm no longer that person, due to growing up and all, but mostly because i realize there's a flaw in the argument against minimum wage.

Yes **i agree that minimum wage could make unemployment rise** the thing is; **economy is more than just employment number, it's also about buying power**.

Keeping minimum wage low may entice businesses to hire more people, but what good would that do **if most of those employed need food stamps to make ends meet?**

OTOH raising the minimum wage would increase economic activity due to rise in workers buying power, which in turn increases prosperity.

My point is rise in unemployment, if it even happens, due to raising minimum wage is a small price to pay for economic prosperity it would bring.

2013-09-06,1378478507,Can I still be a Libertarian? A little rant/self debate I had the other night and figured I'd post.,"OK I have been a Libertarian for most of my adult life now (30 years old) but I cannot really see myself being aligned with this group anymore. I am all for self determination and the good ole' picking yourself up by your bootstraps approach to capitalism but I am becoming really disillusioned. Law makers are constantly massively enriching themselves (farm subsidies, massive contracts to become lobbyists once they are no longer in Congress) while the impoverished are left to fend for themselves (Cutting food stamps, really?). 


I realize that these lawmakers are not libertarians but it seems most of the libertarians rally around these officials because they are seen as the lesser of two evils. 


Libertarians never seem to discuss anything but cutting taxes, loosening gun laws and how much of an ass Obama is; to people who are not libertarians or are not familiar with the thought process behind Libertarianism this makes us look like a bunch of Anti-Obama, poorly educated, gun nuts who follow heel to toe on what any conservative law maker says (And in my opinion The Tea Party is nothing but shills for huge corporations, just getting that out there). 


So here's the breakdown:

I want government out of my life.

I do not feel that The Constitution or Bill of Rights are followed by the law makers and police departments of this country.

I don't think the government should be able to tell me what I do on my land (as long as I am not endangering public safety).

I believe in my natural given liberties and I feel they are infringed upon by the government on a daily basis.

I think less government is better government BUT not in all cases.


HOWEVER

I do feel minimum wage should be increased to keep up with inflation and to allow for the poor/middle classes to have a shot at the American Dream.

I feel corporations should be highly taxed as they reap huge benefits from the freedom and advantages that this country provides them. (When you CEO makes more in an hour then I do in a month, you can afford to pay high taxes).

I think Marijuana should be legalized and taxed (although some drugs needs to remain criminalized).

I think there are necessary government institutions (Environmental Agencies, Department of Education {Even though they are in need of a complete overhaul} National Parks, Department of Transportation, few more)

The argument from ""statists"" is that we all are better off when the populous is educated, and I don't disagree with that thesis.  However, the ""solution"" so far has been to establish public schools.  These schools exist to ""help the poor"" who can't afford to send their kids to school.  

I believe in free markets, and that all schools should be private.  Usually, when I say this, people say ""well then only rich people will get to go to school"".  But how come that argument never comes up when we talk about food?  If poor people can't pay for food, we give them subsidies in the form of foodstamps.  I disagree with this fundamentally, but it makes me wonder; why isn't the argument the same for food as it is for schools?  How come the government hasn't established food stores where you can just go get food for free?  They could control the quantity of food you get based on income/dependents or whatever they wish.

Why is a ""public option"" ok for education but not for food?  Or for gasoline for that matter?  Or clothing?  Or any of the other myriad of things that people need to survive?

It may be cleaning the roadways of trash, painting and repairing public housing, whatever we find for you.

2013-07-16,1373954047,"Thoughts on minimum wage, welfare, and a basic standard of living","I'm not trying to push some kind of agenda, these are just my current thoughts which tend to change over time. I was just reading an article that someone posted about how important it is to have a high minimum wage. The author had all kinds of numbers and statistics trying to 'prove' that minimum wage should be higher. In reality though, minimum wage is just one possible solution to the problem of ensuring that people have at least a certain standard of living.

In a quote from the article, she states: ""I dont want to live in any kind of dog-eat-dog Ayn Rand erotic fantasy. Human beings are worth more than that. Anyone who works 40 hours a week (nevermind 74 hours) ought be able to take care of all the basic necessities in life.""

Whether or not you believe that society should have a certain minimum standard of living for everyone is another debate, but I'm going to proceed forward with the assumption that we do want a minimum standard for every human being in our country.

It's pretty clear to me that minimum wage is not the correct solution because it restricts the free market. For example, lets say I own a bookstore. There are a bunch of science-fiction books that I want someone to read and give them a rating and 1-paragraph review. It turns out that there are a lot of people in my town that love reading science-fiction books. I should be able to hire someone for just a couple dollars an hour to do this job because there is a lot of demand for it and only one job available. Instead, in the minimum wage system, I don't hire anyone to do this job because it's not worth X dollars per hour.

Like minimum wage, welfare is intended to create a minimum standard of living. It does so through a huge bureaucratic process where people have to fill out an application which is sent to a team of government reviewers who if they deem the application to be worthy will give the applicants little stamps which they can trade for food at certain locations. Again, a pretty crappy system in my view.

So, what's the solution? Well, as someone who enjoys simplicity, I was thinking of something very simple. Abolish minimum wage and welfare. Replace it with the 'Base Salary'. The 'Base Salary' would be a system where the government gives every single person in the United States a certain fixed amount of money per year. Whether you were making $20,000 per year or millions per year, you would get the same Base Salary.

At this point, most of you probably think this is a terrible idea, but I'd be happy to debate with you in the comments. I like the concepts of progressive libertarianism and so I have fun trying to think of ways to improve our current system with incremental changes. The key is to make things better without pissing everyone off ;)

**Edit Below**
===============

People are trying to argue that the math/economics don't work out, but it seems fine to me. Here's a very simple mini-economy. Let me know why this wouldn't work:

**How things are now**

Quinton: $120k / year - $60k in taxes

Roger: $20k / year on welfare

Government: collected $60k in taxes - 25k/year administering welfare - $35k/year other services

OK, ignore my title and just consider the post of that title: ""When a worker is on food stamps, that's an employer that is relying on taxpayers to augment wages, to bring workers up to the bare minimum they need to survive.""

They assume that workers on food stamps are just barely surviving.  They make giant leap that employers are using the government.

Why can't an employer just set wages because that is the rate they set for that particular task?  And that is the rate that people will take that particular job?",Libertarian,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/1efct4/fallacious_arguments_on_politics_workers_on_food/

However, I realized that just like our current system, it would be prone to abuse. If we are subsidizing people with money, wouldn't it be easier for them to abuse it compared to food stamps and the like and buy stuff like steaks and TVs rather than healthcare and necessary non-luxury foods?

I want to say audit the people receiving negative income tax annually to make sure that they are spending money accordingly. If they spend their money on luxuries, they lose the money.

Also, how would we encourage increased productivity for those on NIT, so they can eventually stop receiving it? Like what sort of incentives could be provided? A criticism of NIT is that since people are receiving ""free"" money and will meet the minimum income, wouldn't that disincentivize (is that a word?) increased productivity?

I know something of the like was covered in a thread last week, but from what I read, a lot of people just breezed over the concept and not much of what we would do if it were implemented. I want to hear about how you guys would approach this.

Local and state governments follow behind the federal government.  Essentially, the US government follows a true libertarian model.

This will happen suddenly, so no more food stamps, no public housing or healthcare or any big government programs.

A lot of people will be on their own (E.g. their public housing is dismantled).

How do you address those members of society that won't accept the new government.  For example, there may be a large number that won't act responsibly, they won't seek employment or care for themselves.

I'm personally a Center Libertarian, as I believe firmly in the Non-Aggression Principle governing what is and isn't a crime, but I also strongly believe in social programs like Food Stamps, Housing, and Social Security as they are in the country right now, as well as lightly regulated Free Markets, sort of like they are right now :) Basically the only thing I really want to see change is an increase in Civil Liberties across the board, and the ironing out of existing systems.

2023-03-21,1679436307,"Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of a Vaccination Card","So, I live in the mildly communist state of California, I'm 20 years old, and I just got a great job I've wanted for awhile. They require me to get Covid-19 vaccinations and a booster, which I don't have or want. Ironically, if I lived in Texas, I wouldn't need a vaccine at all. I disagree wholeheartedly with the recent mandates and crackdowns with Covid-19 from the past few years, and I've become so angry with the way the world responded to the entire ""pandemic"". I graduated high school two years ago on a computer in a halfway house in the middle of the desert in the palm springs area if that tells you anything about what it's like to be in my generation throughout Covid (I'm a recovering addict).

When the lockdown started I was very happy with the way that things were going. I had just gotten out of a group home and was excited to not have to worry about school and run around with my fellow drug addicts and cause chaos to my little suburban city. I dove into a crippling addiction to meth, fentanyl, and crack. I went homeless 3 times, overdosed 4, I went to 6 rehabs, and have seen a lot of those old friends die in my process of getting clean. I don't want to say that Covid-19, or the lockdown, or my state's policies ""made me become an addict"" because that would be a lie. However, I don't think it's a coincidence that the number of fentanyl overdoses have rapidly increased since the lockdown. I don't think it's a coincidence that methamphetamine has never been cheaper on the streets as our borders are practically unprotected under President Biden. 

It feels as if government policies have been consistently stuffed down my throat for 3 years now; because of my addiction and growing up in general I'm just now beginning to form opinions on these issues. My point is that I don't want to get the vaccine because I feel that I have a right to refuse it as a citizen. I hate the fact that my job, after all of these near death experiences, after, after the pain of seeing my friends die, and trying to survive on the streets of LA... my source of income is contingent on a debatably dangerous vaccine for a disease that has killed far less people than the lockdown itself did. And if the vaccine were so important to the state of California, where were they when I was homeless? If I remember correctly, we were not given vaccines, we were given food stamps and welfare checks. Currently, even after getting out of that lifestyle, I'm ironically in the process of trying to commit forgery because I don't want to comply with this stupid policy. The government does not give a shit about people like me who want to get their lives together, and have no business on mandating this bullshit policy for someone like me. I am so grateful for people like Jordan Peterson and Ben Shapiro who have shed some light on this issue and just wanted to share my experience.",Libertarian,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/11xwevk/life_liberty_and_the_pursuit_of_a_vaccination_card/
2022-10-28,1666980386,How the federal government caused minorities in the U.S. to struggle,"As someone who is quite inquisitive in the sense where I like to learn more about different things, I wanted to learn more about why things are the way they are. Why are life circumstances the way they are for everyone right now? And after research, and time to think, I've came to the conclusion that everything we see around us, it's all by design. Have you ever wondered why drugs in the U.S. are a problem when several decades ago it wasn't?

I believe the federal governments destruction of minority communities started in the late 70s. Jimmy Carter was a radical liberal for his time. And he proposed Welfare bills and Food stamp bills for various amounts of people. For people unemployed, single parents trying to raise kids, and people just struggling. This on paper sounds fine, and granted, some people do take advantage of it, but at the time of it's inception, it was fine. But later on events only made things worse.

In the 80s, when the U.S. was trying to stop Communism from expanding, the C.I.A. was of course aiding anti-communist factions in various countries. In order to help this one gang gather enough money for weapons and supplies, the C.I.A. (under Regan) started selling crack and other drugs into American cities and towns with the gangs so they could raise money. That was a horrible mistake. The U.S. is still suffering today, and even our neighbors down south, thanks to that. The drugs ended up targeting minority communities too. And then to make things worse, Regan created the [Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Drug_Abuse_Act_of_1986) as a part of the War on Drugs to make the Government seem innocent when they designed the issue themselves. Then, there was the icing on the cake.

In the 90s, then Senator Joe Biden, along with President Bill Clinton started passing out excessive and ruthless crime bills targeting minorities in their respective locations, the laws went after the most stupid things too such as Marijuana, non-violent gun offenses, and so on. Many were arrested because of this. And this is when society really focused on the concept of police brutality and the police having too much power. This is when a cycle was created. People are suffering from illegal drug abuse. People get sent to brutal prisons due to that, and are took away from their families, kids, spouses.

Single mothers raising kids get put on welfare and food stamps and no longer have to work. Then kids growing up in poverty, around drugs, and with their fathers taken away and traumatized by it and then they are more likely to grow up and ""commit crime"", it's an endless cycle, rinse and repeat. Now, with all that being said, did Carter, Regan, the C.I.A., Clinton and Biden all tend for things to be this way? Did they all want minorities to struggle? I'm honestly not too sure. The main reason is because all of these bills and operations happened decades apart. But regardless, now they have all came together and caused a big problem, and left wing or right wing, it's all thanks to the federal government.

So, what can we do about this? Well, we need to ease drug and gun laws, release those for drug crimes and those who committed non-violent gun offenses. Make drugs legal, and then those making money from them illegally won't make as much if drugs are easier to obtain and legal tender. Most people likely wouldn't do heroin or crack at this point anyways because many of us know how harmful they can be. Laws with food stamps and welfare checks should be at the state level, not federal. I don't think these solutions will completely fix the issues started, but I believe they can make things not as bad.",Libertarian,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/yfw4l5/how_the_federal_government_caused_minorities_in/

Their is no doubt that this state is going to vote R in elections. And despite the promises that party makes about small governments and tax cuts, taxes are worse here than other places. 

Not to mention I live in a low-income area, with management personnel being payed barely over 10-11$ at some of the local businesses, any by this I mean the people who are trusted with safes full of money, finances, and security information, not just telling teens what to do at a McDonalds (which still pays better on average) 

Taxes on groceries can raise the price of a gallon of milk to almost 4$, which is a terrible price considering the general pay of the area. 

It doesnt help that this is a smaller town without a lot of competition, but as somebody who worked as a cashier here for over a year, I saw a ton of people on food stamps or other aid. Even people I would always see working regular shifts in the other local businesses still needed to use it to buy groceries. 

This isnt a commentary on welfare programs by any means, but its annoying to see me, my friends, and my families money be taken from us at extreme rates just so it can go right back to people that would otherwise be able to pay for things with their own earned money had everything not been taxed so heavily. 

As you can probably tell, I think very negatively of the current tax system. Im starting to do remote/ freelance work and Im realizing just how much they take from us each year. Just how much they earn every year, and how little of it seems to go to any valid uses. 

I mentioned republicans earlier as they seem to be the ones most loudly preaching about taxes, yet most all of the discourse I see is about cutting taxes for the millionaires and not giving a damn about taxes that affect most people, or about using that tax money more practically to give back to their citizens.  

And also just how strongly they oppose corporate or wealth taxes. It just seems gross and discouraging that all of the talk on news and podcasts and crap about this stuff is just about rich people and not about the average American.

His voice rose: ""Oh God, who is--"" and broke off.

""-- John Galt?"" she asked.

""Yes,"" he said, and shook his head as if to dispel some vision, ""only I don't like to say that.""

""I don't, either. I wish I knew why people are saying it and who started it.""

""What?""

""Me or about six thousand others. We might have. I think we did. I hope we're wrong.""

""What do you mean?""

""Well, there was something that happened at that plant where I worked for twenty years. It was when the old man died and his heirs took over. There were three of them, two sons and a daughter, and they brought a new plan to run the factory. They let us vote on it, too, and everybody -- almost everybody -- voted for it. We didn't know. We thought it was good. No, that's not true, either. We thought that we were supposed to think it was good. The plan was that everybody in the factory would work according to his ability, but would be paid according to his need. We -- what's the matter, ma'am? Why do you look like that?""

""What was the name of the factory?"" she asked, her voice barely audible.

""The Twentieth Century Motor Company, ma'am, of Starnesville, Wisconsin.""

""Go on.""

""We voted for that plan at a big meeting, with all of us present, six thousand of us, everybody that worked in the factory. The Starnes heirs made long speeches about it, and it wasn't too clear, but nobody asked any questions. None of us knew just how the plan would work, but every one of us thought that the next fellow knew it. And if anybody had any doubts, he felt guilty and kept his mouth shut -- because they made it sound like anyone who'd oppose the plan was a child-killer at heart and less than a human being. They told us that this plan would achieve a noble ideal. Well, how were we to know otherwise? Hadn't we heard it all our lives -- from our parents and our school-teachers and our ministers, and in every newspaper we ever read and every movie and every public speech? Hadn't we always been told that this was righteous and just? Well, maybe there's some excuse for what we did at that meeting. Still, we voted for the plan -- and what we got, we had it coming to us. You know, ma'am, we are marked men, in a way, those of us who lived through the four years of that plan in the Twentieth Century factory. What is it that hell is supposed to be? Evil -- plain, naked, smirking evil, isn't it? Well, that's what we saw and helped to make -- and I think we're damned, every one of us, and maybe we'll never be forgiven...

""Do you know how it worked, that plan, and what it did to people? Try pouring water into a tank where there's a pipe at the bottom draining it out faster than you pour it, and each bucket you bring breaks that pipe an inch wider, and the harder you work the more is demanded of you, and you stand slinging buckets forty hours a week, then forty-eight, then fifty-six for your neighbor's supper -- for his wife's operation -- for his child's measles -- for his mother's wheel chair -- for his uncle's shirt -- for his nephew's schooling -- for the baby next door -- for the baby to be born -- for anyone anywhere around you -- it's theirs to receive, from diapers to dentures -- and yours to work, from sunup to sundown, month after month, year after year, with nothing to show for it but your sweat, with nothing in sight for you but their pleasure, for the whole of your life, without rest, without hope, without end... From each according to his ability, to each according to his need...

""We're all one big family, they told us, we're all in this together. But you don't all stand working an acetylene torch ten hours a day -- together, and you don't all get a bellyache -- together. What's whose ability and which of whose needs comes first? When it's all one pot, you can't let any man decide what his own needs are, can you? If you did, he might claim that he needs a yacht -- and if his feelings is all you have to go by, he might prove it, too. Why not? If it's not right for me to own a car until I've worked myself into a hospital ward, earning a car for every loafer and every naked savage on earth -- why can't he demand a yacht from me, too, if I still have the ability not to have collapsed? No? He can't? Then why can he demand that I go without cream for my coffee until he's replastered his living room? ... Oh well... Well, anyway, it was decided that nobody had the right to judge his own need or ability. We voted on it. Yes, ma'am, we voted on it in a public meeting twice a year. How else could it be done? Do you care to think what would happen at such a meeting? It took us just one meeting to discover that we had become beggars -- rotten, whining, sniveling beggars, all of us, because no man could claim his pay as his rightful earning, he had no rights and no earnings, his work didn't belong to him, it belonged to 'the family' -- and they owed him nothing in return, and the only claim he had on them was his 'need' -- so he had to beg in public for his relief from his needs, like any lousy moocher, listing all his troubles and miseries, down to his patched drawers and his wife's head colds, hoping that 'the family' would throw him the alms. He had to claim miseries, because it's miseries, not work, that had become the coin of the realm -- so it turned into a contest among six thousand panhandlers, each claiming that his need was worse than his brother's. How else could it be done? Do you care to guess what happened, what sort of men kept quiet, feeling shame, and what sort got away with the jackpot?

""But that wasn't all. There was something else that we discovered at the same meeting. The factory's production had fallen by forty percent, in that first half-year, so it was decided that somebody hadn't delivered 'according to his ability.' Who? How could you tell it? 'The family' voted on that, too. They voted which men were the best, and these men were sentenced to work overtime each night for the next six months. Overtime without pay -- because you weren't paid by time and you weren't paid by work, only by need.

""Do I have to tell you what happened after that -- and into what sort of creatures we all started turning, we who had once been human? We began to hide whatever ability we had, to slow down and watch like hawks that we never worked any faster or better than the next fellow. What else could we do, when we knew that if we did our best for 'the family,' it's not thanks or rewards that we'd get, but punishment? We knew that for every stinker who'd ruin a batch of motors and cost the company money -- either through his sloppiness, because he didn't care, or through plain incompetence -- it's we who'd have to pay with our nights and our Sundays. So we did our best to be no good.

""There was one young boy who started out, full of fire for the noble ideal, a bright kid without any schooling, but with a wonderful head on his shoulders. The first year, he figured out a work process that saved us thousands of man-hours. He gave it to 'the family,' didn't ask anything for it, either, couldn't ask, but that was all right with him. It was for the ideal, he said. But when he found himself voted as one of our ablest and sentenced to night work, because we hadn't gotten enough from him, he shut his mouth and his brain. You can bet he didn't come up with any ideas, the second year.

""What was it they'd always told us about the vicious competition of the profit system, where men had to compete for who'd do a better job than his fellows? Vicious, wasn't it? Well, they should have seen what it was like when we all had to compete with one another for who'd do the worst job possible. There's no surer way to destroy a man than to force him into a spot where he has to aim at not doing his best, where he has to struggle to do a bad job, day after day. That will finish him quicker than drink or idleness or pulling stick-ups for a living. But there was nothing else for us to do except to fake unfitness. The one accusation we feared was to be suspected of ability. Ability was like a mortgage on you that you could never pay off. And what was there to work for? You knew that your basic pittance would be given to you anyway, whether you worked or not -- your 'housing and feeding allowance,' it was called -- and above that pittance, you had no chance to get anything, no matter how hard you tried. You couldn't count on buying a new suit of clothes next year -- they might give you a 'clothing allowance' or they might not, according to whether nobody broke a leg, needed an operation or gave birth to more babies. And if there wasn't enough money for new suits for everybody, then you couldn't get yours, either.

""There was one man who'd worked hard all his life, because he'd always wanted to send his son through college. Well, the boy graduated from high school in the second year of the plan -- but 'the family' wouldn't give the father any 'allowance' for the college. They said his son couldn't go to college, until we had enough to send everybody's sons to college -- and that we first had to send everybody's children through high school, and we didn't even have enough for that. The father died the following year, in a knife fight with somebody in a saloon, a fight over nothing in particular -- such fights were beginning to happen among us all the time.

""Then there was an old guy, a widower with no family, who had one hobby: phonograph records. I guess that was all he ever got out of life. In the old days, he used to skip meals just to buy himself some new recording of classical music. Well, they didn't give him any 'allowance' for records -- 'personal luxury' they called it. But at that same meeting, Millie Bush, somebody's daughter, a mean, ugly little eight-year-old, was voted a pair of gold braces for her buck teeth -- this was 'medical need,' because the staff psychologist had said that the poor girl would get an inferiority complex if her teeth weren't straightened out. The old guy who loved music, turned to drink, instead. He got so you never saw him fully conscious any more. But it seems like there was one thing he couldn't forget. One night, he came staggering down the street, saw Millie Bush, swung his fist and knocked all her teeth out. Every one of them.

""Drink, of course, was what we all turned to, some more, some less. Don't ask how we got the money for it. When all the decent pleasures are forbidden, there's always ways to get the rotten ones. You don't break into grocery stores after dark and you don't pick your fellow's pockets to buy classical symphonies or fishing tackle, but if it's to get stinking drunk and forget -- you do. Fishing tackle? Hunting guns? Snapshot cameras? Hobbies? There wasn't any 'amusement allowance' for anybody. 'Amusement' was the first thing they dropped. Aren't you always supposed to be ashamed to object when anybody asks you to give up anything, if it's something that gave you pleasure? Even our 'tobacco allowance' was cut to where we got two packs of cigarettes a month -- and this, they told us, was because the money had to go into the babies' milk fund. Babies was the only item of production that didn't fall, but rose and kept on rising -- because people had nothing else to do, I guess, and because they didn't have to care, the baby wasn't their burden, it was 'the family's'. In fact, the best chance you had of getting a raise and breathing easier for a while was a 'baby allowance'. Either that, or a major disease.

""It didn't take us long to see how it all worked out. Any man who tried to play straight, had to refuse himself everything. He lost his taste for any pleasure, he hated to smoke a nicke's worth of tobacco or chew a stick of gum, worrying whether somebody had more need for that nickel. He felt ashamed of every mouthful of food he swallowed, wondering whose weary nights of overtime had paid for it, knowing that his food was not his by right, miserably wishing to be cheated rather than to cheat, to be a sucker, but not a blood-sucker. He wouldn't marry, he wouldn't help his folks back home, he wouldn't put an extra burden on 'the family'. Besides, if he still had some sort of sense of responsibility, he couldn't marry or bring children into the world, when he could plan nothing, promise nothing, count on nothing. But the shiftless and the irresponsible had a field day of it. They bred babies, they got girls into trouble, they dragged in every worthless relative they had from all over the country, every unmarried pregnant sister, for an extra 'disability allowance,' they got more sicknesses than any doctor could disprove, they ruined their clothing, their furniture, their homes -- what the hell, 'the family' was paying for it! They found more ways of getting in 'need' than the rest of us could ever imagine -- they developed a special skill for it, which was the only ability they showed.

""God help us, ma'am! Do you see what we saw? We saw that we'd been given a law to live by, a moral law, they called it, which punished those who observed it -- for observing it. The more you tried to live up to it, the more you suffered; the more you cheated it, the bigger reward you got. Your honesty was like a tool left at the mercy of the next man's dishonesty. The honest ones paid, the dishonest collected. The honest lost, the dishonest won. How long could men stay good under this sort of a law of goodness? We were a pretty decent bunch of fellows when we started. There weren't many chiselers among us. We knew our jobs and we were proud of it and we worked for the best factory in the country, where old man Starnes hired nothing but the pick of the country's labor. Within one year under the new plan, there wasn't an honest man left among us. That was the evil. the sort of hell-horror evil that preachers used to scare you with, but you never thought to see alive. Not that the plan encouraged a few bastards, but that it turned decent people into bastards, and there was nothing else that it could do -- and it was called a moral ideal!

""What was it we were supposed to want to work for? For the love of our brothers? What brothers? For the bums, the loafers, the moochers we saw all around us? And whether they were cheating or plain incompetent, whether they were unwilling or unable -- what difference did that make to us? If we were tied for life to the level of their unfitness, faked or real, how long could we care to go on? We had no way of knowing their ability, we had no way of controlling their needs -- all we knew was that we were beasts of burden struggling blindly in some sort of place that was half-hospital, half-stockyards -- a place geared to nothing but disability, disaster, disease -- beasts put there for the relief of whatever whoever chose to say was whichever's need.

""Love of our brothers? That's when we learned to hate our brothers for the first time in our lives. We began to hate them for every meal they swallowed, for every small pleasure they enjoyed, for one man's new shirt, for another's wife's hat, for an outing with their family, for a paint job on their house -- it was taken from us, it was paid for by our privations, our denials, our hunger. We began to spy on one another, each hoping to catch the others lying about their needs, so as to cut their 'allowance' at the next meeting. We began to have stool pigeons who informed on people, who reported that somebody had bootlegged a turkey to his family on some Sunday -- which he'd paid for by gambling, most likely. We began to meddle into one another's lives. We provoked family quarrels, to get somebody's relatives thrown out. Any time we saw a man starting to go steady with a girl, we made life miserable for him. We broke up many engagements. We didn't want anyone to marry, we didn't want any more dependents to feed.

""In the old days, we used to celebrate if somebody had a baby, we used to chip in and help him out with the hospital bills, if he happened to be hard-pressed for the moment. Now, if a baby was born, we didn't speak to the parents for weeks. Babies, to us, had become what locusts were to farmers. In the old days, we used to help a man if he had a bad illness in the family. Now -- well, I'll tell you about just one case. It was the mother of a man who had been with us for fifteen years. She was a kindly old lady, cheerful and wise, she knew us all by our first names and we all liked her -- we used to like her. One day, she slipped on the cellar stairs and fell and broke her hip. We knew what that meant at her age. The staff doctor said that she'd have to be sent to a hospital in town, for expensive treatments that would take a long time. The old lady died the night before she was to leave for town. They never established the cause of death. No, I don't know whether she was murdered. Nobody said that. Nobody would talk about it at all. All I know is that I -- and that's what I can't forget! -- I, too, had caught myself wishing that she would die. This -- may God forgive us! -- was the brotherhood, the security, the abundance that the plan was supposed to achieve for us!

""Was there any reason why this sort of horror would ever be preached by anybody? Was there anybody who got any profit from it? There was. The Starnes heirs. I hope you're not goting to remind me that they'd sacrificed a fortune and turned the factory over to us as a gift. We were fooled by that one, too. Yes, they gave up the factory. But profit, ma'am, depends on what it is you're after. And what the Starnes heirs were after, no money on earth could buy. Money is too clean and innocent for that.

""Eric Starnes, the youngest -- he was a jellyfish that didn't have the guts to be after anything in particular. He got himself voted as Director of our Public Relations Department, which didn't do anything, except that he had a staff for the not doing of anything, so he didn't have to bother sticking around the office. The pay he got -- well, I shouldn't call it 'pay,' none of us was 'paid' -- the alms voted to him was fairly modest, about ten times what I got, but that wasn't riches. Eric didn't care for money -- he wouldn't have known what to do with it. He spent his time hanging around among us, showing how chummy he was and democratic. He wanted to be loved, it seems. The way he went about it was to keep reminding us that he had given us the factory. We couldn't stand him.

""Gerald Starnes was our Director of Production. We never learned just what the size of his take of -- his alms -- had been. It would have taken a staff of accountants to figure that out, and a staff of engineers to trace the way it was piped, directly or indirectly, into his office. None of it was supposed to be for him -- it was all for company expenses. Gerald had three cars, four secretaries, five telephones, and he used to throw champagne and caviar parties that no tax-paying tycoon in the country could have afforded. He spent more money in one year than his father had earned in profits in the last two years of his life. We saw a hundred-pound stack -- a hundred pounds, we weighed them -- of magazines in Gerald's office, full of stories about our factory and our noble plan, with big pictures of Gerald Starnes, calling him a great social crusader. Gerald liked to come into the shops at night, dressed in his formal clothes, flashing diamond cuff links the size of a nickel and shaking cigar ashes all over. Any cheap show-off who's got nothing to parade but his cash, is bad enough -- except that he makes no bones about the cash being his, and you're free to gape at him or not, as you wish, and mostly you don't. But when a bastard like Gerald Starnes puts on an act and keeps spouting that he doesn't care for material wealth, that he's only serving 'the family,' that all the lushness is not for himself, but for our sake and for the common good, because it's necessary to keep up the presige of the company and of the noble plan in the eyes of the public -- then that's when you learn to hate the creature as you've never hated anything human.

""But his sister Ivy was worse. She really did not care for material wealth. The alms she got was no bigger than ours, and she went about in scuffed, flat-heeled shoes and shirtwaists -- just to show how selfless she was. She was our Director of Distribution. She was the lady in charge of our needs. She was the one who held us by the throat. Of course, distribution was supposed to be decided by voting -- by the voice of the people. But when the people are six thousand howling voices, trying to decide without yardstick, rhyme or reason, when there are no rules to the game and each can demand anything, but has a right to nothing, when everybody holds power over everybody's life except his own -- then it turns out, as it did, that the voice of the people is Ivy Starnes. By the end of the second year, we dropped the pretense of the 'family meetings' -- in the name of 'production efficiency and time economy,' one meeting used to take ten days -- and all the petitions of need were simply sent to Miss Starnes' office. No, not sent. They had to be recited to her in person by every petitioner. Then she made up a distribution list, which she read to us for our vote of approval at a meeting that lasted three-quarters of an hour. We voted approval. There was a ten-minute period on the agenda for discussion and objections. We made no objections. We knew better by that time. Nobody can divide a factory's income among thousands of people, without some sort of a gauge to measure people's value. Her gauge was bootlicking. Selfless? In her father's time, all of his money wouldn't have given him a chance to speak to his lousiest wiper and get away with it, as she spoke to our best skilled workers and their wives. She had pale eyes that looked fishy, cold and dead. And if you ever want to see pure evil, you sould have seen the way her eyes glinted when she watched some man who'd talked back to her once and who'd just heard his name on the list of those getting nothing above basic pittance. And when you saw it, you saw the real motive of any person who's ever preached the slogan: 'From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.'

""This was the whole secret of it. At first, I kept wondering how it could be possible that the educated, the cultured, the famous men of the world could make a mistake of this size and preach, as righteousness, this sort of abomination -- when five minutes of thought should have told them what would happen if somebody tried to practice what they preached. Now I know that they didn't do it by any kind of mistake. Mistakes of this size are never made innocently. If men fall for some vicious piece of insanity, when they have no way to make it work and no possible reason to explain their choice -- it's because they have a reason that they do not wish to tell. And we weren't so innocent either, when we voted for that plan at the first meeting. We didn't do it just because we believed that the drippy old guff they spewed was good. We had another reason, but the guff helped us to hide it from our neighbors and from ourselves. The guff gave us a chance to pass off as virtue something that we'd be ashamed to admit otherwise. There wasn't a man voting for it who didn't think that under a setup of this kind he'd muscle in on the profits of the men abler than himself. There wasn't a man rich and smart enough but that he didn't think that somebody was richer and smarter, and this plan would give him a share of his better's wealth and brain. But while he was thinking that he'd get unearned benefits from the men above, he forgot about the men below who'd get unearned benefits, too. He forgot about all his inferiors who'd rush to drain him just as he hoped to drain his superiors. The worker who liked the idea that his need entitled him to a limousine like his boss's, forgot that every bum and beggar on earth would come howling that their need entitled them to an icebox like his own. That was our real motive when we voted -- that was the truth of it -- but we didn't like to think it, so the less we liked it, the louder we yelled about our love for the common good.

""Well, we got what we asked for. By the time we saw what it was that we'd asked for, it was too late. We were trapped, with no place to go. The best men among us left the factory in the first week of the plan. We lost our best engineers, superintendents, foremen and highest-skilled workers. A man of self-respect doesn't turn into a milch cow for anybody. Some able fellows tried to stick it out, but they couldn't take it for long. We kept losing our men, they kept escaping from the factory like from a pesthole -- till we had nothing left except the men of need, but none of the men of ability.

""And the few of us who were still any good, but stayed on, were only those who had been there too long. In the old days, nobody ever quit the Twentieth Century -- and, somehow, we couldn't make ourselves believe that it was gone. After a while, we couldn't quit, because no other employer would have us -- for which I can't blame him. Nobody would deal with us in any way, no respectable person or firm. All the small shops, where we traded, started moving out of Starnesville fast -- till we had nothing left but saloons, gambling joints and crooks who sold us trash at gouging prices. The alms we got kept falling, but the cost of our living went up. The list of the factory's needy kept stretching, but the list of its customers shrank. There was less and less income to divide among more and more people. In the old days, it used to be said that the Twentieth Century Motor trademark was as good as the karat mark on gold. I don't know what it was that the Starnes heirs thought, if they thought at all, but I suppose that like all social planners and like savages, they thought that this trademark was a magic stamp which did the trick by some sort of voodoo power and that it would keep them rich, as it had kept their father. Well, when our customers began to see that we never delivered an order on time and never put out a motor that didn't have something wrong with it -- the magic stamp began to work the other way around: people wouldn't take a motor as a gift, if it was marked Twentieth Century. And it came to where our only customers were men who never paid and never meant to pay their bills. But Gerald Starnes, doped by his own publicity, got huffy and went around, with an air of moral superiority, demanding that businessmen place orders with us, not because our motors were good, but because we needed the orders so badly.

""By that time, a village half-wit could see what generations of professors had pretended not to notice. What good would our need do to a power plant when its generators stopped because of our defective engines? What good would it do to a man caught on an operating table when the electric light went out? What good would it do to the passengers of a plane when its motor failed in mid-air? And if they bought our product, not because of its merit, but because of our need, would that be the good, the right, the moral thing to do for the owner of that power plant, the surgeon in that hospital, the maker of that plane?

""Yet this was the moral law that the professors and leaders and thinkers had wanted to establish all over the earth. If this is what it did in a single small town where we all knew one another, do you care to think what it would do on a world scale? Do you care to imagine what it would be like, if you had to live and to work, when you're tied to all the disasters and all the malingering of the globe? To work -- and whenever any men failed anywhere, it's you who would have to make up for it. To work -- with no chance to rise, with your meals and your clothes and your home and your pleasure depending on any swindle, any famine, any pestilence anywhere on earth. To work -- with no chance for an extra ration, till the Cambodians have been fed and the Patagonians have been sent through college. To work -- on a blank check held by every creature born, by men whom you'll never see, whose needs you'll never know, whose ability or laziness or sloppiness or fraud you have no way to learn and no right to question -- just to work and work and work -- and leave it up to the Ivys and the Geralds of the world to decide whose stomach will consume the effort, the dreams and the days of your life. And this is the moral law to accept? This -- a moral ideal?

""Well, we tried it -- and we learned. Our agony took four years, from our first meeting to our last, and it ended the only way it could end: in bankruptcy. At our last meeting, Ivy Starnes was the one who tried to brazen it out. She made a short, nasty, snippy little speech in which she said that the plan had failed because the rest of the country had not accepted it, that a single community could not succeed in the midst of a selfish, greedy world -- and that the plan was a noble ideal, but human nature was not good enough for it. A young boy -- the one who had been punished for giving us a useful idea in our first year -- got up, as we all sat silent, and walked straight to Ivy Starnes on the platform. He said nothing. He spat in her face. That was the end of the noble plan and of the Twentieth Century.""

...

""But what about John Galt?"" she asked. ... ""You were going to tell me who was the John Galt they mean -- if there ever was such a person.""

""I hope there wasn't, ma'am. I mean, I hope that it's just a coincidence, just a sentence that hasn't any meaning.""

""You had something in mind. What?""

Freedom of movement is the idea of being able to travel or move about, nation to nation, even within a nation, without someone asking to ""see your papers"".  

&amp;nbsp;

As a libertarian philosophy, its definitely rooted in freedom and the NAP.  

&amp;nbsp;

Where we run into practical issues, atleast in the United States, is when you have a government which provides an incentive.

Meaning government/tax payer handouts: welfare, food stamps, free education, free healthcare, free housing etc.    

&amp;nbsp;

If there were no government handout system, for citizens and non-citizens alike, but especially for non-citizens, people would have much less of an issue with immigration, freedom of movement etc, even ""open"" borders.

2021-12-08,1639001830,The basic difference between a liberal and a conservative.,"both liberalism and conservatism can be infinitely complex subjects full with a lot of generalizations and what not. 

Both Libs and Cons believe poor people might need help at times in order to make it. The basic difference difference between the 2 groups is how to approach the problem of helping out the needy and the poor. 

Liberals believe in helping out the poor through welfare. Through wealth redistribution. Through taxation of the rich and giving to the poor.

Conservatives believe in helping out the poor through charity. 

The difference between the twos is that liberals don't believe it should be voluntary. They believe we should coerce the *haves* to pay for the *have nots* through involuntary taxation. This requires force through the threat of violence. So liberals believe in violence when it comes to paying for welfare. Conservatives do not. We are sooo use to this system that we don't see the violence behind it. So the state is able to get away with it.

There is a joke on this. Both Hillary and Trump are walking down the street. They see a poor man. Trump gives the poor man a 5$ bill. Hillary on other hand takes 20 dollars away from Trump and gives the man 5$ and keeps 15$ for ""administration fee"".

Liberals will say ""well it is a voluntary system! By being born and living in society you agreed to it! Its call a social contract!"" This is just some mad up BS someone pulled out of there ass. And they think just because they said it therefore it most be true. 

This is why I don't believe people who believe in welfare can not be a libertarian. The initiation of force, through the threat of violence is a violation of the non aggression principle. This is why i believe conservatism is more align with libertarianism. conservatism/trumpism/republicanism have their own laundry list of pro statist problems. I dont deny it.

Even if welfare did work it would still be a violation of the NAP. But does welfare work? Has welfare improve the lives of poor people or black people in the US? Trillions have been wasted on welfare in the US. Trillions more has been wasted on welfare in foreign aid to Africa. Have things gotten better? The answer is no. Welfare in the form of food stamps, lone star card, public housing, or any other welfare BS program do not work.

One of the main reason welfare does not work is because when you pay for something you get more of if. So if you pay poor single moms for having a litter you get more poor single moms with a big litter. I heard African governments purposely keep their people poor for the sake of getting more foreign aid.

It amazes me how liberals see themselves as morally superior and tolerate and more virtuous but this are the last people who would agree to end the welfare state. They believe in taxation through the threat of violence. They think people are too stupid and too evil to take care of each voluntary so they vote for a government system that forces us to do so. 

But in the end we get a government system that takes care of itself and their friends all while crime and poverty continue to rise. And here we are arguing about stupid ass like a bunch of monkeys screaming at each other about subjects like white privilege or transgenderism for kids while trillions get transferred to the super rich.",Libertarian,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/rc2hdi/the_basic_difference_between_a_liberal_and_a/

2021-07-29,1627567468,"""the government"" is not greedy. Libertarians are","

""The government"" is not greedy. It is physically impossible for ""the government"" to be greedy. Who do think gets richer if more taxes are collected? Do they think there's a man in a building whose name is ""government"""" and he gets to buy another yacht if the tax revenue increases by 3%?

Do they think Pelosi gets to buy another summer home when she raises taxes?

Whoo Do they think is benefiting from that? The government is not a for-profit company like Exxon or halliburton or any of the other companies that libertarians worship.. taking in more revenue for a year doesn't make any member of the government richer..

They don't get executive bonuses like the people at walmart. The CEO doesn't increase his salary..

Regardless of how much tax revenue is collected the president still gets paid the same amount. The speaker of the House still gets paid the same amount. Every member of the Senate still have the same salary. Whether taxes go up or down..

 because the government wass not a company.

So the idea that ""greedy government"" is raising your taxes to ""benefit itself"""" is ridiculous

There's nobody in charge of the government. It's a collection of thousands of different people with different agendas and different jobs all working together to govern the country and make it better. And there's nobody in government who benefits When taxes go up..

You know who benefits When taxes go up? Poor working class americans.. the people that get to receive more food stamps. More public housing. Better infrastructure.. those are the people that benefit when taxes go up. Not some greedy person in government..

And those are the exact type of people that libertarians don't want to benefit. Libertarians want rich people to benefit at the expense of poor people. Not poor people to benefit at the expense of rich peoplee

The real reason libertarians always hated taxes.. they want the poor to suffer. They want the poor to have LESS

Other things like roads aren't important to rich people because they can just build their own private roads or take a helicopter.. so why have taxpayer-funded roads if the rich people won't benefit from it?.

Wh have food stamps when rich people don't benefit from it?

I feel like they are going to make Trump out like they made Bush out. Some republican did 911. Both sides are controlled by the same entity.

 Imo if everyone could own their own two acres of land as if it was their own country and land could only be traded with other land we would be better off. Multiple people could combine their land. People could own land in multiple locations. The reason I said two acres is because the acreage of the US divided by the population is seven. For the world it is five. Subtract undesirable land and I assume you get around two acres. I suppose it could be maxed out with the ownership of multiple locations. Tax free, mineral and air rights included. One or a group's own business could be operated without the unsolicited tax and regulations of an exterior party. The problem is who would want to give up their land if they own more than 7 acres? The government has gold and other reserves of resources and commodities that could pay for it. The standing military and it's weapons and resources could be dispersed through out a people's militia. I assume people would want to trade their land to be closer to like minded people, friends and family.

When talking to someone and being with someone remember you enjoy their presence and you want to be on the same side. Be thankful for their success.

The workers need suicide nets around Apple factories in China because the government is not educated to give and treat people decently. The US struggles with suicide because people are not educated in mercy justice peace and kindness through grammer logic rhetoric passion and ethics. The Torah must be instilled into the hearts of men

That is were the argument of the individualist and the collectivist can enter the room. Realistically people should work for as much as they eat. When someone breaks their leg or loses their mind is where mercy can be bestowed ubon them. Realistically from the mercy they bestowed to others. That is justice. Showing mercy to someone who did not show mercy? Is that just? Is that merciful?

I am grateful for mercy and justice and I admit I need mercy and deserve justice

Anywho people thinking they are better than others leads to affliction

Pride is the opposite

How? Humility is a part of righteousness

Key word: education.

I try to question what I hear and take what I hear with a grain of salt. I want to understand for myself to be able to expel accurately, instead of blindly following what one man says. One teacher is greater than his student and he is lesser to the teacher to which he is a student of. Doesn't this mean the teacher is not perfect and is always learning? Love is mercy and justice. It does not seem merciful or just to punish someone for something they do not understand. Correcting someone who does not work with poverty makes sence. I am greatful for the merciful chance  I am given to be successful after all the times I have failed. I hope I am given and take what is needed to be written in the book of righteousness. I do not want lead anyone astray and only want to lead closer to righteousness. Many authoritarian governments have been unjust and merciless. This is why I lean towards volenteerism, educating individuals to be less selfish and to be more giving for righteousness. Without the use of forcing people into a cage at gun point for not paying taxes.

That's were the education of treating people decently in a volenteeristic society comes into play. Selling a light bulb that doesn't burn out for athousand years or a Tesla tower to build better life instead of selling a light bulb that goes out in 20 years just sell more

The fascist socialistic rulers control the media. An earlier example would be when an entity decieved a society into thinking they lost a war reducing the price of poperty just to buy it up funding both sides

And I dont like paying taxes to an entity that kidnaps people into cages at gun point if they don't and decieves them
Roads can be private. Stock shares are a thing.

To work for the betterment of others and not just selfish increace. However forcing people to serve others at gun point is not good. Educating articulating using retoric grammar logic passion and ethics

The Nazis were a government. We have a government now. Politics religion military and economics are pillars of Babylon and means of control. We must seek the truth. Volenteerism is anarchy except people are educated to be decent to eachother Authoritarianism if the forcing of will from one group of people to another.

Animalistic Selfishness goes against our purpose. Make the world better. Everthing good in life is a gift from the Creator.

Thanks for the feed back. I hate to get political but I don't worry about global warming, the earth goes through cycles and 10,000 years from now it won't matter much.

2021-02-25,1614268532,How to protect against personal exploitation,"It seems to me as a society we need to protect the elderly and mentally feeble from personal exploitation. Im talking about Nigerian Prince scams and other fraud of that sort.

Why? Well if we dont prevent the weak from exploitation than we are building a society where the most conniving and immoral people flourish at the expense of the weak.

The same issue occurs with powerful corporations duping the general population. For example: In the US the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) puts their heart healthy stamp of approval on corn chips and sugar packed cereal. Obviously the notion that these  foods are healthy is incredibly misleading.

So where exactly does the duty of protection fall?

I look at some of the shit these people say and I am just baffled.

1) I saw a post that said if you're a Republican and dont believe in socialism then dont use fire/ems, police, social security or any other public services. First off wheres the unity they were talking about? Second off who the hell are they to be saying what I can and csnt use? If I am legally obligated to pay taxes when I get older and rate social security, you're damn right that I will be asking for MY money back. Second off it doesnt matter if you are an illegal immigrant not paying taxes or a taxpayer you have a right to life saving medical or police response. Finally it's not what people are saying, if we are legally required to pay taxes most of us are okay with a hardworking american getting food stamps or section 8 if they are working and actively trying to better themselves getting benefits. What bothers most of us is a 25 yr old troglodyte with depression getting disability, welfare, section 8 and food stamps and havent payed a tax in their life. I'm a usmc vet with crippling back issues, major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder but I work why can't you?

2) The Jan 6 riots were treason but not the 10 month long BLM riots that caused billions of dollars in damages, dozens of murders and the assault of unarmed civilians and uniformed police officers?

3) Anyone not on the left is racist, but they're the only ones constantly bringing it up. 

4) Accept the election results. Really? Is that what you all did when you sought therapy when Trump won? How about the four years of calling him an illegitimate president? What about the 2 yr long impeachment trial where you used 30 million plus dollars in government assets? Or was it the 4 yrs of constantly bashing Trump on the news?

2021-01-15,1610747590,I have a theory on why everyone in the United States is pissed off right now (including pre-pandemic) and am interested to hear your thoughts.,"In the United States, our system of government is somewhat vague. Our Constitution is quite open to interpretation and our legal system (Common Law; except Louisiana) requires that laws be vague such that precedent may ""round out the edges"" over time. These things were done intentionally, so as to allow for unforseen requirements of the government. One can argue if this is good or bad, but that's not what I'm here to discuss; I'm simply using what exists to propose a theory for explaining the chaotic events that seem to keep escalating. This vagueness opens the door for modification by those in charge.


People in power are able to adjust what their capabilities are based on their interpretation of the Constitution and their interpretation of the law to develop precedent. Examples include: Social Security, Unemployment Benefits, Medicare, Food Stamps, etc. being passed using the reference to general welfare in the Preamble and Taxing and Spending Clause of the Constitution; CIA, NSA, FBI, Homeland Security, etc. being passed using the reference to providing for the nation's defense in the Preamble of the Constitution; many firm breakups being determined by precedent created by interpretation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act; and corporate personhood more or less being developed by the courts in Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Co.


These systems and the way they work require that our officials act in good faith; lest they bend interpretations to their own personal gain. The Founding Fathers recognized this, which is why they created a system in which the people control their government and hold them accountable through voting, protest, and ultimately (as the very last case scenario) overthrow of the government (the primary reason they developed the 2nd amendment).


Recently (relative to the age of the United States), elections have been less and less about the candidate's policies and how they may interpret the law and more about their personality and broad appeal. This has caused the citizenry to be less trusting and certain in their elected officials. The Women's March, protests of the inauguration of Donald Trump, BLM protests, Capitol riots, and upcoming protests of the inauguration of Joe Biden are all no longer regarding protest and concern over what is happening and have changed to protest regarding what could happen (with the notable exception being the BLM protests in which it is a hybrid; concern over what happened/had been happening as well as what the police could possibly do in the future without present action). The overwhelming shift toward protesting what could come as opposed to what has been done is indicative of the fact that people have become less trusting that the officials in power will interpret the law to the people's best interest.


Additionally, as the people have lost faith in the system (because they believe it has been changed by interpretations acting in the officials' best interests [not arguing if they're right, just pointing out how they're thinking]) they will not trust those put into office by the system. This means that the distrust cannot be remedied, because the only way for it to be fixed is for officials elected by the system to interpret the laws of the system in ways that modify the very system that appointed them (which will be very hard to convince the citizenry that they are doing, because the very people who have to claim they are fixing the system the citizenry don't like are appointed by the system the citizenry don't like). To make this confusing dilemma easier to understand, it's like if Darth Vader had told Luke he totally hated Palpatine and proved it by beating him with a stick (the stick here being reinterpretations of the law against their own self interest, Palpatine being the current system, and Darth Vader being a hypothetical official appointed by the system). Luke (the citizenry) would be really skeptical given that Vader is only hurting Palpatine and was trained and propped up by Palpatine, meaning this could all just be an elaborate ruse. It's only when Vader yeets Palpatine off a cliff that Luke can be certain he is telling the truth. The issue is that if we bring our metaphor back to the real world, that means the citizenry will continue to be pissed until someone shows them they really do want to change the system by completely destroying it (which 9 times out of 10 means a dictatorship).


 As the citizenry continue to lose faith in the people in charge of interpreting the law, I predict that we will find an increase in the number of protests about what could happen as opposed to what has happened as well as increased anger as those in charge of interpretation continue to act more and more in their own self interest.


**Bonus**: This also does a pretty excellent job at describing Trump (if I do say so myself). He was a complete outsider who didn't confirm to the system, meaning that a lot of people got behind him because it looked like a hope that he would tear down all of the interpretations that made the system the way it is because it wouldn't really affect him. My theory as to why he didn't get reelected is because people realized he didn't really do this, and just sort of became comfortable in the system.


TLDR: The US system requires trust in the officials as the system of laws is open to interpretation intentionally. The people have slowly lost faith in those officials over time and things are now culminating in a situation in which the citizenry distrust the system because it was crafted by people interpreting in ways favorable to themselves. This distrust in the system means they will distrust officials appointed by the system, meaning trust cannot be regained and protests will escalate.",Libertarian,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/ky4udy/i_have_a_theory_on_why_everyone_in_the_united/
2020-12-29,1609257511,[Discussion] Libertarians are generally against social welfare programs. What are the alternative solutions to the problems that social programs currently solve for everyday Americans?,"I understand that Libertarians, generally, advocate against most social programs such as Medicare for All, Unemployment insurance, EBT/Food stamps, etc. But the reality is many people rely on these programs to survive or have a somewhat decent quality of life. 

To use Social Security as an example, what should be done in situation where someone fails to save for their retirement? Should we just say ""You have to face the consequences of your own actions"" and let them become homeless? At the end of the day there will always be people will slack in life and put themselves in a bad situation. Although they've often done it to themselves, I still have enough sympathy to believe that we shouldn't let these people go homeless and/or hungry. 

If you advocate against Social Security, do you believe we should let them face the very unfortunate fate they've brought upon themselves? Are there alternative solutions to this problem that are better than Social Security? I can't think of any.

Although I used Social Security retirement as an example here, the spirit of the questions is more board and applies to other social programs also.",Libertarian,71,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/kmgz2b/discussion_libertarians_are_generally_against/
2020-12-18,1608319557,Black America Before LBJ: How the Welfare State Inadvertently Helped Ruin Black Communities," *We waged a war on poverty and poverty won.*

[President Ronald Reagan](https://ammo.com/articles/ronald-reagan-quotes), 1988 State of the Union Address 

The dust has settled and the evidence is in: The 1960s Great Society and War on Poverty programs of President Lyndon Baines Johnson (LBJ) have been a colossal and giant failure. One might make the argument that social welfare programs are the moral path for a modern government. They cannot, however, make the argument that these are in any way effective at alleviating poverty.

In fact, there is evidence that such aggressive programs might make generational poverty worse. While the notion of a culture of dependence is a bit of a cliché in conservative circles, there is evidence that this is indeed the case  that, consciously or not, the welfare state creates a culture where people receive benefits rather than seeking gainful employment or business ownership.

This is not a moral or even a value judgment against the people engaged in such a culture. Again, the claim is not that people choose to be on welfare, but simply that social welfare programs incentivize poverty, which has an [impact on communities](https://ammo.com/articles/bowling-alone-washington-destroy-american-civil-society-family) that has nothing to do with individual intent.

We are now over 50 years into the development of the Great Society and the War on Poverty. It is time to take stock in these programs from an objective and evidence-based perspective. When one does that, it is not only clear that the programs have been a failure, but also that they have disproportionately impacted the black community in the United States. The current state of dysfunction in the black community (astronomically high crime rates, very low rates of home ownership and single motherhood as the norm) are *not* the natural state of the black community in the United States, but closely tied to the role that social welfare programs play. Or as [Dr. Thomas Sowell](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/thomas-sowell) stated:

&gt;If we wanted to be serious about evidence, we might compare where blacks stood a hundred years after the end of slavery with where they stood after 30 years of the liberal welfare state. In other words, we could compare hard evidence on the legacy of slavery with hard evidence on the legacy of liberals.

Heres a peek into how black America has been a victim of LBJs Great Society and War on Poverty.

## Defining Terms: What Is the Great Society and the War on Poverty?

Before going further, we must define the terms [Great Society](https://www.history.com/topics/1960s/great-society) and [War on Poverty](https://www.britannica.com/topic/War-on-Poverty). These are two overlapping, but somewhat distinct terms that are, in any event, not the same as welfare as a whole.

The War on Poverty refers to one part of the Great Society, namely the part focused specifically on poverty. When the War on Poverty was started in 1964, the poverty rate in America was [19 percent](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/01/13/whos-poor-in-america-50-years-into-the-war-on-poverty-a-data-portrait/). Seeing an opportunity to recreate the same [New Deal](https://www.history.com/topics/great-depression/new-deal) magic that had propelled [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt](https://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/franklin-d-roosevelt) to the White House in four successive elections 30 years earlier, Johnson pushed his War on Poverty.

Its worth noting that the New Deal has some success to boast in terms of lifting some extremely poor communities, particularly those in the rural South, out of grinding forms of poverty. This was through, for example, [mass electrification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_Electrification_Act) and other similar campaigns, which radically redefined the experience of the poor in the United States. One can argue about the ethics of redistributive wealth programs, but one cannot argue about whether or not, for example, the electrification of the Tennessee Valley elevated people out of crushing and abject poverty  it did.

There are four primary initiatives of the War on Poverty:

1. [**The Economic Opportunity Act**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Opportunity_Act_of_1964)**:** This was the flagship effort of the War on Poverty. It created the [Community Action Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Action_Agencies), [Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA)](https://www.nationalservice.gov/programs/americorps/americorps-programs/americorps-vista) and [Job Corps](https://www.jobcorps.gov/).
2. [**The Food Stamp Act of 1964**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Stamp_Act_of_1964)**:** This created a food stamp program that remained largely in place until President Bill Clinton ended welfare as we know it. At this time, food stamps were open-ended and could, in theory, be a means of feeding a family for life.
3. [**Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1964**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_and_Secondary_Education_Act)**:** This is known as the most sweeping legislation impacting education passed by the United States Congress. It sought to level an alleged achievement gap in public education. It has been reauthorized by both Democratic and Republican presidents under the names [Improving Americas Schools Act of 1994](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improving_America%27s_Schools_Act_of_1994), [No Child Left Behind Act of 2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Child_Left_Behind_Act), and the [Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015](https://www.ed.gov/essa).
4. [**Social Security Act of 1965**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Amendments_of_1965)**:** Created both [Medicare](https://www.medicare.gov/index) and [Medicaid](https://www.medicaid.gov/).

The Economic Opportunity Act, in particular, was insidious in that it gave broad leeway to create programs without Congressional approval or oversight. An example of this is the [Head Start](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ohs) program, which is shown to have only [extremely limited and short-term effects](https://www.heritage.org/education/commentary/head-start-doesnt-work) on the ability of children to succeed in public schools.

The Great Society refers to a far broader set of programs, some of which still exist today, others of which were casualties of both the massive budget for the [Vietnam War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War), LBJs other pet project, as well as the passage of time and subsequent Republican administrations. Its difficult to summarize the Great Society as a whole, precisely because its scope was so broad. Education, health, welfare, culture (the [Corporation for Public Broadcasting](https://www.cpb.org/), for example, is a product of the Great Society), transportation, the environment, housing, labor and rural development were all areas where the Great Society had some hand.

Whereas the New Deal has demonstrably impacted communities with crushing and severe forms of poverty, the Great Society has demonstrably not only *not* worked by any available metric, it has also created a negative impact, most severely felt in the black community in the United States.

This article will make the case that the Great Society is the greatest disaster to befall Americas black community since slavery.

## What Were the Goals of the Great Society?

Some discussion of the goals of the Great Society and its historical context are in order. The Great Society was seen by LBJ as nothing less than the completion of the New Deal as pioneered by his predecessor and mentor, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

The thinking was basically this: The New Deal proved that government intervention could have some impact on poverty. As we stated above, there is some truth to this, albeit in a limited sense. The New Deal was able to lift incredibly poor people out of what were effectively Third World conditions in the United States. Because Johnson had at his disposal the best and the brightest, he believed that all he needed to do was apply their technocratic acumen to the problem of poverty and it would be solved.

One of the glaring and immediate differences between the New Deal (where it was successful) and the Great Society was the definition of poverty. Poverty, the kind the New Deal was effective at reducing, was largely an objective condition. For example, people without electricity or running water in their homes. For the Great Society programs, however, poverty was largely defined in subjective, albeit quantifiable, terms like educational attainment and income level.

Heres the problem with defining poverty in those terms: We now live in a world where the overwhelming majority of people who wish to get one can obtain a college degree. All this has done is devalue the college degree and saddle people with both unmarketable skill sets and a high level of nondischargeable debt. A college degree simply doesnt mean much anymore because anyone who wants one can have one.

Similarly, consider income in real terms  the ability to buy things. The poorest people in America now have access to more computing power in their pocket than NASA used to go to the moon. Cheap consumer goods are plentiful, even for people with very low incomes  part-time minimum wage jobs, for example.

Poverty, defined as making much less than rich people or even struggling to get by simply means one is at the bottom of the economic ladder. The bottom of the economic ladder will always exist as long as there is one. Grinding, Third-World-style poverty  in the vast overwhelming majority of cases  is a thing of the past. The United Nations puts the percentage of Americans with access to electricity at 100.

A report estimated that [1.6 million Americans lack access to clean water](https://www.freep.com/story/opinion/contributors/2019/01/16/drinking-water-contamination/2452475002/), clean here being a weasel word that is undefined. Even if we took the 1.6 million figure at face value (which we should not), this means that approximately 0.48 percent of all Americans (i.e., less than half of one percent) do not have access to clean water.

In the absence of significant poverty conditions to attack, the War on Poverty was largely about hitting a moving target subjectively defined as having less than some other people.

Despite the best intentions (to which, it should be noted, the road to hell is paved with), the Great Society was bound to fail simply because there were no clear targets. In this sense, the War on Poverty prefigured other government wars on abstract concepts, such as the [War on Drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_drugs) and the [War on Terror](https://www.history.com/topics/21st-century/war-on-terror-timeline).

The failure, of course, is seen by big government advocates as a sign that not enough has been done. Since the War on Poverty began, [$15 trillion](https://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/constitution/item/11864-the-war-on-poverty-$15-trillion-and-nothing-to-show-for-it) has been spent, with negligible impact on lifting people out of poverty. For context, the Apollo program cost [$25.4 billion](https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/186600-apollo-11-moon-landing-45-years-looking-back-at-mankinds-giant-leap), $146.1 billion in 2019 dollars. Put simply, for the cost of the War on Poverty, America could have funded almost seven Apollo programs.

Unlike the War on Poverty, the Apollo program was a resounding and verifiable success.

## The Breakdown of the Black Family

&gt;The black family, which had survived centuries of slavery and discrimination, began rapidly disintegrating in the liberal welfare state that subsidized unwed pregnancy and changed welfare from an emergency rescue to a way of life.  
 [Thomas Sowell](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/thomas-sowell)

The biggest problem resulting from the Great Society is the breakdown of the black family. This is a sensitive subject, but one that must be broached to fully understand the devastating impact that the Great Society has had on the black community in the United States.

In 1965, when the Great Society began in earnest following the massive electoral landslide reelection of LBJ, the out-of-wedlock birthrate among the black community was 21 percent. By 2017, this figure had risen to a [whopping 77 percent](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/77-black-births-to-single-moms-49-for-hispanic-immigrants). In some cities, this rate is [as high as 80 percent](http://archive.discoverthenetworks.org/viewSubCategory.asp?id=1261), with most of the unwed mothers being teenagers. We have documented extensively in our article on [the death of civil society in the United States](https://ammo.com/articles/bowling-alone-washington-destroy-american-civil-society-family) the negative effects of the single-parent household on child development and outcomes. The black community is now entering its third generation of single parenthood as the norm, something that rose astronomically with the advent of the Great Society.

To provide some historical context, the out-of-wedlock birth rate in the black community was already rising before the Great Society. In 1938, that rate stood at [11 percent](https://www.dailysignal.com/2017/09/20/black-family-struggling-not-slavery/). Still, its worth noting the difference between the slow and steady increase of 1938 to 1965, and the explosive growth from 1965 until the present day. In any event, black women were more likely to be married than white women [as late as 1950](http://archive.discoverthenetworks.org/viewSubCategory.asp?id=1261). Its also worth looking at single parenthood over time: In the 1950s, 52 percent of all black children lived with both parents until the age of 17. By the 1980s, that number had plummeted to 6 percent.

In addition to outcomes, there is also a wide divide between the percentage of black families in poverty when there is a father present. Among married black families, the poverty rate is 8 percent. Among black households headed by a single mother, that rate jumps to 37 percent.

And again, while we outline a number of negative consequences resulting from single-parent families, its worth pulling one out in relation to the destruction of the black family in America: There is no better predictor of male criminality than being raised in a fatherless home. 70 percent of all juvenile offenders in state reform institutions were raised in fatherless homes. This includes 60 percent of all rapists, 72 percent of all murderers, and 70 percent of long-term inmates.

## Black Participation in the Labor Market

There is another statistic that is significant when it comes to evaluating the role of the Great Society in the destruction of the black family and, by extension, black society: participation in the labor market.

This is an important metric for a very simple reason: Few would argue that its better to not work than to work. Data provided by every census between 1890 and 1954 shows that black Americans were just as active  and sometimes more  in the labor market than their white counterparts. [In 1900](https://www.dailysignal.com/2017/09/20/black-family-struggling-not-slavery/), for example, black unemployment was 15 percent *lower* than white unemployment. In 2017, it was 30 percent *higher*.

If the conventional narrative on black American poverty and general social dysfunction were correct  that this was caused by the legacy of slavery, Jim Crow, and private discrimination  wouldnt we expect to see a *decline* in black unemployment rather than the opposite?

## Black Business Ownership

Of course, participation in the labor market is not the only metric of economic activity. Another is business ownership. The years between 1900 and 1930 are known as [the Golden Age of Black Entrepreneurship](https://www.library.hbs.edu/hc/AASU/the-golden-age-of-black-business/). By 1920, there were tens of thousands of black businesses in the United States, the overwhelming majority of them very small, single proprietorship. This in no way diminishes the importance of this sector of the black economy. People who had, in many cases, started their lives as slaves were now, even when poorer in terms of income, freer than many of their white counterparts who worked for wages.

There was also a social aspect to this period of black entrepreneurship. Black insurance companies and black-owned banks represent the apex of the economic pyramid in the black community. While the black community was comparatively poorer than its white counterparts, money spent by black Americans could stay within the black community. Thus, the black community could enrich itself from the bottom of the ladder all the way up to the top.

This concept was known as [double duty dollars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-duty_dollar). The idea is that money spent at black businesses not only purchased goods for the consumer, but also played a role in advancing the black race in America. This, and not government handouts, was seen as the primary means of achieving, if not a perfect equality with whites, a social parity with them.

Another aspect of why black entrepreneurship was so important in the black community was that national businesses tended to ignore the black market entirely. This, however, began to change in the 1950s and, to a much greater extent, by the dawn of the next decade. No one forced national businesses to begin marketing their products to black America. National businesses simply saw that there was an emerging black middle class with money to spend and didnt want to get cut out of the market.

Today, black business ownership is in a state of collapse according to [Marketplace.org](https://www.marketplace.org/2017/04/14/business/black-owned-independent-businesses/). This cannot entirely be laid at the foot of the Great Society. For example, the unlikely culprit of integration is one of the reasons that the black business districts began to fall apart. For example, once the biggest burger joint in town would serve black people, there was no reason to go to the black burger joint anymore.

Still, its impossible to separate the end of the thriving black business districts from the Great Society. These were once centers of the community, in addition to being centers of commerce. Now they are virtually extinct. While other factors are in play, its difficult to not notice the overlap between the rise of the welfare state through the Great Society, the overall decline in the black communitys civil society anchored by the black business community, and black business ownership in general.

## The Decline in Black Homeownership

Another area where the impact of Great Society policies is seen is in statistics on black homeownership. The black homeownership rate is basically [the same today as it was 50 years ago](https://www.curbed.com/2018/3/13/17101142/black-homeownership-fair-housing-act). There was a spike in black homeownership during the Bush years. However, these were largely a function of subprime mortgages being given out to people who couldnt really afford them.

Few places saw the hand of government on the scale more than housing. One of the final policy initiatives of the Great Society was the [Fair Housing Act](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/fair_housing_act_overview), which banned discrimination in housing sales (but not in lending practices). This effectively meant an end to restrictive covenants, which allowed a homeowner to specify that their house could not be sold to a black family, not just for an individual sale, but in perpetuity.

As a brief aside, this is, as are many other parts of the Great Society, an egregious attack on freedom of association, property rights, and ability to transact and dispose of ones property in a manner of ones own choosing.

## Which Way Forward for the Black Community

Its difficult to ignore that [black Americans vote overwhelmingly for the Democratic Party](https://blackdemographics.com/culture/black-politics/), who champion the policies of the Great Society, which have largely destroyed the black family and black civil society. Why is this?

There are a number of factors in play here. First, the Democratic Party has little incentive to provide innovative solutions for such a loyal voter bloc. Black Americans have voted at over 80 percent for Democratic Party candidates since 1964. In several elections (1964, 2000, 2008 and 2012) they voted over 90 percent for the Democratic Party candidate. The highest share of the black vote received by the Republican Party since 1964 was 15 percent, achieved by Richard Nixon in 1968 and Gerald Ford in 1976. While Donald Trumps performance among black voters has been touted for its strength, he received only 8 percent of the vote, reversing a trend where the black vote dropped as low as 4 percent in 2008. Despite the much-touted Blexit, 2018 saw no significant exodus from the Democratic Party on the part of black voters  [a scant 9 percent voted for Republicans](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/11/08/the-2018-midterm-vote-divisions-by-race-gender-education/).

The flip side of this is that there is not much incentive on the part of Republicans to court black voters. While the Nixon [Southern Strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy) is slightly distorted when presented, the core of this narrative is true  when presented with various strategies for victory, Nixon chose to appeal to northern, union Catholic workers and Southern Protestant conservatives, both of whom were white. This is simple math: A large increase in the black vote doesnt represent a whole lot of votes, but a minor increase in the white vote moves the needle significantly. The so-called [Sailer strategy](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/04/steve-sailer-invented-identity-politics-for-the-alt-right.html?gtm=top), named after [Steve Sailer](https://twitter.com/Steve_Sailer), exploits this math: Spiking the rural white vote to record levels while effectively ignoring all other voting blocs is what delivered Donald Trump the presidency.

The point here is that neither party is incentivized to offer solutions to black Americans. But black Americans are also not demanding solutions from either political party, as evidenced by the lockstep voting for Democratic Party politicians, despite failing to deliver anything of value in 50 years.

One historical example that might represent a way forward is the [National Black Independent Political Party](http://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n86814400). Formed in 1988, it had virtually no impact on electoral politics. However, its model might represent something of value for black Americans looking to break free of the two-party duopoly and demand actual policy solutions from Washington. The purpose of the NBIPP was not to obtain power in its own right, but rather to form black America into a political voting bloc that could act as kingmaker in elections. This is in the broader tradition of [self-reliance in the black community](https://ammo.com/articles/guns-nra-and-american-civil-rights-movement-guide).

Whatever the way forward is, one thing is clear: Social welfare programs ostensibly designed to help the black community have done little more than put the boot of government on the neck of black Americans. Rather than raising up the black community, these programs have acted to  despite whatever their intentions might be  destroy the black family, the black business community, and black social solidarity.

What might work depends on what the goal is. However, the evidence is in and the Great Societys War on Poverty has been a resounding failure.

Everyone seems to make this claim about high-tax, high-subsidy countries, and it is way too commonly accepted as fact.

No.

If you *have to pay* in order to get the thing, *it is not free/cheap*.

If healthcare was the only thing that you took part of from the government in a given year, and you paid 50% of your income to the government in taxes, you did *not* pay ""only $150"" for healthcare. You paid $150 + (0.5)\*(taxable income). If you made $20,000 that year, you paid ***$10,150*** for healthcare. If university was the only thing you took part of from the government that year instead of healthcare, it *was not free*, you paid ***$10,000*** out of pocket for university that year. No matter what you take part in, you are paying $10,000 that year; it is *not free*.

You could make the argument that we use a ton of stuff that the government publicly provides, but [how much stuff](https://www.nationalpriorities.org/budget-basics/federal-budget-101/spending/) do we really take part in every year to get our money's worth, considering in the US FICA/SS is taxed separate from income tax (i.e. you have to exclude it from benefits received), roads (transportation) only account for 2.22% of the federal budget, and most benefits go towards specific other people or things (ex. NASA, studies, unemployment, food stamps, veterans, interest on debt) instead of what we personally make use of every year? And how much of it do we actually get a choice in, considering both that we get Social Security even if we never asked for it, and that the government enforces their own monopoly on roads, municipal revenue (tickets)/policing, and licensing via annual property taxes? And is it right that we make other people foot the bill just because they made more money even though they themselves are not receiving the advantage of it (if someone makes $100,000 after graduating from university, they paid $50,000 on... what? They might be getting the advantage of $10,000 in personal benefits that they are getting back but paying $40,000 on *your* university bill)?

2020-10-14,1602717729,Top 10 Libertarian Lies,"




 
 

For a short time -; it seemed like the libertarian cancer in American politics was finally dead. Rand Paul -; the supposedly electableson of Ron Paul -; ended his train wreck of a campaign after a pathetic showing at the polls. The Republicans instead chose Donald Trump -; the least libertarian candidate in the race. On the Democratic side -; democratic socialist Bernie Sanders built a massive movement around his decidedly anti-libertarian ideas.

But I should have known better than to discount the corporate class. Led by the Koch brothers -; the 1% did not give up on their agenda. As their traditional Republican venues disappeared -; they headed to their last resort: the Libertarian Party.

**Lie #10: The founding fathers were libertarian**

More than anything else -; libertarians love to call themselves classical liberals -; beckoning us back to the early days of this nation. For a group that despises our government -; they have a strange admiration for those who created itt

It is unlikely that many of the founders would have admired them back. In the late 1700s -; governments across the world were almost universally undemocratic. Within that context -; some of the founders were wary of government overreach. However -; they did not focus their disapproval on regulations and services designed to protect the poor. In fact -; classical liberal Thomas Jefferson vocally supported progressive taxation -; adding that whenever there are in any country uncultivated lands and unemployed poor -; it is clear that the laws of property have been so far extended as to violate natural right. Similarly -; John Jay said that nothing is more certain than the indispensable necessity of government [and the idea that] the people must cede to it some of their natural rights. While Im no great fan of the founding fathers -; they were no libertarians.


Lie #9: The problem is crony capitalism -; not capitalism


When we point out the injustices within the capitalist system -; libertarians will often claim that the real problem is crony capitalism. While it is sadly true that the rich often do get favors -; blaming crony capitalism reflects a disturbing naivete. The poor both pay less to and receive more from the US government than the rich -; yet our system is still grotesquely unfair and tilted against the disadvantaged. Its not crony capitalism thats behind this unfair tax system - it is capitalism. Its also not crony capitalism that allows employers to pay their workers starvation wages - it is capitalism. Nor is it crony capitalism that incentivizes collusion -; fraud -; and the creation of barriers to entry - it is capitalism. Finally -; its not crony capitalism that rewards class privilege -; -; and intellectual privilege- it is capitalism. The reality is that the neoliberal destruction of the middle class did not come about through crony capitalist giveaways -; which are barely reflected in the government budget. It came about through the tax cuts -; spending cuts -; and deregulation championed by libertarians.

Lie #8: Tax cuts trickle down
 
 

Incidentally -; this lie is more often associated with conservatives than libertarians. Many libertarians are dogmatic radicals who oppose all taxation -; and for them -; it doesnt matter whether tax cuts hurt the poor and the middle class. However -; there are a number of libertarians who -; like conservatives -; point at the Laffer curve -; and say that cutting taxes can actually increase our tax revenue through economic growth.
Obviously -; cutting taxes to 0% (or 5%) will not increase tax revenues. There is a revenue-maximizing rate&and economists estimate that it is between 68% and 80%. Tax cuts wont increase tax revenue -; since our highest tax rates arent even remotely close to those numbers. And while tax cuts for the rich do stimulate the economy to some extent -; in the end they are usually paid for through devastating cuts to social programs. Plus -; wealth transfers to the needy offer a far greater stimulus.


Lie #7: The rich deserve to be rich -; and the poor deserve to be poor


This is perhaps the most revolting libertarian lie -; that the rich earned their wealth -; and that the poor are just lazy. Libertarians use this lie to justify everything from their hatred of taxation to their shameful neglect of the poor.
It is also ridiculously easy to disprove. Adult children make -; on average -; 33 additional cents for every dollar that their parents make. Of those born in the bottom 20% in the income distribution -; 43% remain in the bottom 20% -; and 70% remain in the bottom 40%. Of those born in the top 20% -; 40% remain there. Thats not because they are getting government favors. Its because in a capitalist society -; those who win the birth lottery have countless advantages.
Furthermore -; for every dollar that a white man makes -; a white woman makes 78 cents -; a black woman makes 64 cents -; and a Hispanic woman makes 54 cents. The income of those with IQ scores in the top 10% is more than double the income of those with an average IQ. Those with certain personality attributes -; like extroversion -; also have higher incomes. 65 people own as much as 3 -;500 -;000 -;000. None of this has anything to do with hard work. In fact -; the productivity of the bottom 90% has increased as their wages remain stagnant. The truth is that our distribution of wealth is wholly based on the lottery of birth -; the injustice of capitalism.
Progressives reject that injustice. Their solution is not to have everyone make the same -; but to help those who fell through the cracks through no fault of their own. They support welfare policies that not only dont discourage the poor from working -; but actually cause them to work harder.


Lie #6: Government is tyrannical

This is perhaps the most successful libertarian lie; the notion that representative government is inherently tyrannical. When they frame the debate as us (the people) vs. them (the government) -; they ignore that we collectively are -; in fact -; our democratically elected government.
When this challenge is brought up -; libertarians tend to counter that they didnt vote for the government -; so its a tyranny of the majority. This -; once again -; exposes the libertarians hopeless naivete. Conflict will always exist in some form -; in which no resolution will ultimately satisfy either person. Therefore -; the just resolution of a conflict will be one of these two options: 1. The resolution which satisfies the most people. 2. The resolution which leads to the most overall satisfaction.
 

Libertarians think this woman is participating in a system of tyranny

https://miro.medium.com/max/1335/1*dwhrcvz3aJVwMdm_rFcgzA.jpeg

The first resolution is satisfied by a direct democracy. The second (seemingly better) resolution is satisfied with a representative democracy. When voting for a representative -; voters are forced to prioritize their concerns -; thus making those who are more passionate about an issue also more influential. Libertarianism -; on the other hand -; is a tyranny of the minority. The libertarian minority wishes to impose their unpopular system of dogmatic property rights onto others. Moreover -; votes in their system are dollars -; distributed through the privileges and disadvantages of the unjust birth lottery.

Lie #5: Libertarians are against big government

Lie #6 is even more egregious when you realize that libertarians are not -; in fact -; opposed to big government at all. Thats because the foundation of libertarianism is property rights. What are property rights? They are restrictions on who can and cannot use property. Who enforces property rights? Most libertarians agree that the government should -; in fact -; enforce property rights.
It doesnt take a genius to understand that a government that gives to the poor is no bigger than a government that protects the property of the rich. In fact -; the government that protects the rich is the real big brother. Because the capitalist distribution of wealth does not reflect the will of the people -; a government which protects that distribution of wealth will need to be larger so as to fight against a democratic uprising.

Lie #4: Libertarians are against aggression -; violence -; and force

All of this inevitably points to an uncomfortable truth for libertarians: that they are just as aggressive -; violent -; and forceful as the rest of us. Their property rights are not peaceful. Imagine -; for a moment -; a scenario in which the IRS walks into your house and collects your taxes from a pile of cash on your table. When you find out -; libertarians say that you can turn a gun on the IRS -; then physically wrench the money from their hands.
In this scenario -; how in the world are you not the one initiating aggressive force? The IRS never touched you or threatened you. Yes -; they took what you consider your property. But if the action was aggressive simply because they took what you personally consider to be your property -; then youre essentially redefining aggression simply as anything that I personally dislike.


Lie #3: Libertarians are moderates 

This is a Johnson favorite. He loves to point out that he sides with Sanders on 73% of the issues. He and the libertarians like to say that they are fiscally conservative and socially liberal. This calls to mind an illusion of moderation -; of taking the best elements of both parties.
 

Many libertarians want to get rid of public schools
And of course its completely false. First of all -; fiscal conservatism implies careful spending -; not slashing spending because of your dogmatic beliefs. Libertarian fiscal policies are more than just fiscal conservatism -; they are downright lunacy. Most libertarians support the virtual elimination of taxes -; Social Security -; Medicare -; Medicaid -; food stamps -; minimum wages -; and public schools. Second of all -; libertarians inevitably prioritize their fiscal conservatism ahead of social liberalism. Every influential libertarian - Hayek -; Rand -; Friedman -; Mises -; Paul - is known for their economics. Finally -; it is impossible to separate fiscal and social issues. There is nothing socially liberal about screwing over the poor. There is nothing socially liberal about private prisons or feeding a glut of gun murders. There is nothing socially liberal about standing by expressions of hatred and discrimination.


Lie #2: A deregulated market helps the poor and the middle class



Libertarians like to say that the free market is a tide that raises all boats. Sometimes I wonder whether any libertarian has ever cracked open a history book. History offers a number of examples of deregulated markets and many examples of strong representative governments. That history lesson is clear.
The most notable example of a libertarian society was the US during the Gilded Age -; a time with virtually no taxes or regulations. Libertarians would be correct to point that aggregate production increased significantly during this period. That is a key characteristic of capitalism; endless production on the backs of the many -; serving the few. The average industrial worker at the time worked 60 hours a week -; making an inflation-adjusted $2 an hour. Children worked in horrific and life-threatening conditions to support their impoverished families. 40% of the population had no wealth at all. Instead -; the wealth all accumulated to a handful of robber barons and their engorged monopolies. Moreover -; the business cycle and financial industry were also completely unregulated. This led to a series of depressions -; including the longest recession in our history.
Since the onset of New Deal regulations -; the US has not once experienced a depression. Much like welfare programs in other countries -; the Great Society slashed poverty in the United States. The post-war period -; when we had 91% marginal tax rates -; contained possibly the greatest and most equitable economic boom in US history. Unfortunately -; this would end with the onset of deregulation and Reagans tax cuts.
Meanwhile -; a different group of nations took the place of the US. The Nordic countries have the highest taxes in the world. Incidentally -; they beat the US in happiness rankings -; median income -; median wealth -; every measurement of quality of life -; as well as life expectancy.


Lie #1: Libertarians love freedom
 
.
Libertarians talk about freedom -; then cheer on the right to discriminate
This may come as a shock for some libertarians -; who built their entire ideology on the notion of freedom: no -; you do not believe in freedom at all. Freedom means the power or right to act -; speak -; or think as one wants without hindrance or restraint. That involves positive freedom -; i.e. the freedom that we need to create for others. If someone working a full-time job cant pay for her groceries -; she does not have freedom. If a sick child is not provided healthcare because her parents cannot afford it -; she does not have freedom. If a young black man cannot attend a private college because of racist administrators -; he does not have freedom. Libertarians oppose mandated help for all of these people -; instead championing the freedom of those who refuse to help.
Ardent libertarians will contort and embarrass themselves to avoid this inescapable truth. Negative rights can be consistent -; theyll argue -; while positive rights contradict each other. Do you know what doesnt contradict itself? Always looking to help others as much as possible. When you can have such a noble goal -; why follow the arbitrary and destructive goal of dogmatic negative freedom? In fact -; libertarians do not pursue negative freedom -; as evidenced by the IRS example noted in Lie #4. The reason that libertarians tie themselves up in knots is as simple as it is breathtaking: they are simply pawns in the game of their corporate masters. In their quest for power -; the 1% will do anything -; even invade our discourse with their sorry and pathetic talking points. But as this election has shown -; the people will only take it so long. Like it or not -; the revolution is coming.",Libertarian,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/jbc1mv/top_10_libertarian_lies/

2020-07-20,1595220924,Need your feedback,"As I posted once before, I'm writing a book refuting socialism. I have done a rough draft of the introduction, and would really appreciate your feedback (socialists are especially encouraged to comment): 

What would be the best way to refute socialism? Economic equations? Empirical evidence? Consider this example: you're walking along a street in your run-of-the-mill big-city, say in the United States, and you come across a common scenario: a homeless man sitting on the road begging, and juxtaposed behind him is a large building with people in expensive clothing coming in and out, and walking by him completely apathetic. You notice that just the watch from one of these people could feed this man for years. Then regardless of your religious or political position, you wonder to yourself why do some have so much and some have almost nothing? Has this man done anything to deserve this? And more importantly, you wonder if there's anything that can done to help this man. Does society have a responsibility to this man, you wonder. Even if you were apolitical up until this point, you could very well now support housing programs for homeless, food stamps, and other welfare programs (we will ignore the fact that most big cities in America already have these programs). Whatever political positions you may adopt from this point, if one is to have a political conversation with you, and especially try to get to change your positions, they must understand your moral imperative first. 

Socialism is similarly a moral philosophy first and foremost. So to both conversate with socialists and to refute socialism, one must first understand the moral theories of socialism. 

What is socialism? 

There are many forms of socialism, as I will list and explain in the next chapter. But there is one common thread underpinning them: common ownership of property (or means of production). As one of the earliest anarchist socialists PJ Proudhon put it in his work What Is Property: 

*""...all men believe and repeat that equality of conditions is identical with equality of rights; that PROPERTY and ROBBERY are synonymous terms; that every social advantage accorded, or rather usurped, in the name of superior talent or service, is iniquity and extortion...
Originally, all things were common and undivided; they were the property of all... if inequality of conditions is a necessary evil, so is isolation, for society and inequality are incompatible with each other. Then, if society is the true condition of man's existence, so is equality also. This conclusion cannot be avoided... 
GOD GAVE THE EARTH TO THE HUMAN RACE: why then have I received none? HE HAS PUT ALL THINGS UNDER MY FEET,and I have not where to lay my head! 
Whoever monopolized the means of production on the ground of greater industry, also destroyed equality. Equality being then the expression of right, whoever violated it was UNJUST.""*

As we can see, to a socialist the very existence of private property is morally egregious. Property should belong to everyone, there is no reason why there should be a capitalist class that owns the means of production and extracts value from the labor of the workers! How a socialist feels about this, is how you would feel if someone came and took all your property, and made you a slave or a serf. This isn't hyperbole, after all part of Marx and Engel's critique of capitalism saw it as a successor to slavery and feudalism. 

One could of course point out to a socialist that workers are vastly better off, to the tune of many magnitudes better off than capitalists themselves who lived when Marx wrote his polemic. This would of course be futile, just as it would be futile if I took your property and made you a slave but then proved to you empirically that you're better off as a slave - you would still want to be free, and still would be angry and morally outraged. This is the case with socialists, because profits can only exist through ""exploitation of labor."" 

Additionally socialism is also democratic, especially the democratic and libertarian variations. As Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) explains it: 

*""Democratic socialists believe that both the economy and society should be run democraticallyto meet public needs, not to make profits for a few. To achieve a more just society, many structures of our government and economy must be radically transformed through greater economic and social democracy so that ordinary Americans can participate in the many decisions that affect our lives. Democracy and socialism go hand in hand. All over the world, wherever the idea of democracy has taken root, the vision of socialism has taken root as welleverywhere but in the United States. Because of this, many false ideas about socialism have developed in the US.""*

So one could also point to the myriads of empirical examples of socialism. But this wouldn't work either, as many of them weren't democratic, or they weren't *""real socialism""* for one reason or another. 

So how would one go about refuting socialism? I believe this can be achieved by taking socialist theorists at their word, and applying logic to them. 

If I were to ask you what would happen if I threw an open bag of money into crowded Times Square, what would you say? One could of course create any number of convoluted ""labor theory of bag throwing,"" theories to explain what would happen, but the answer would be self-evident to everyone: people will rush to grab the money. 
The logic I will use in this book will be similarly strong: self-evident to the point that even socialists won't be able to deny it.

The book will be divided into the following sections:

Chapter 2. Types of socialism

Chapter 3. Public choice theory, &amp; rent-seeking endemic to democracy

Chapter 4. Calculation problem in socialism

Chapter 5. Incentive problem in egalitarian socialism

Chapter 6. Tragedy of the commons 

Chapter 7. Unfreedom of the worker 

Chapter 8. Capitalist vs socialist island: a thought experiment

2020-07-20,1595208698,"This sub is so libertarian that we refuse to censor people with non-libertarian viewpoints. And while that's an overall a very good thing and should be adopted by more subreddits, it sometimes has some unintended consequences: namely a gross misinterpretation of libertarians and their ideology.","libertarianism as an ideology is one doesn't perfectly conform to republican or democratic ideology. There are many narratives being spread by the left and right that libertarians despise, and many libertarian narratives that both the left and right hate.

However, when looking at things from a objective, on average standpoint, libertarianism tends to be more of a right-wing ideology.

In this post, I'm going to try and make some distinctions between libertarianism and what many people on this sub (and what some fake r/conservative libertarians) think libertarianism is.

I'm going to be separating this post based on the people who wrongly call themselves libertarians, starting with leftists, then right-oids, then some takes that are controversial among libertarians themselves.

    Some issues that libertarians are split on and can go either way

1. Abortion: Some libertarians claim that a woman should have a right to do what she wishes with her body. Others claim that the killing of an unborn child are a violation of the NAP.
2. Monopolies: Some libertarians claim that monopolies should be broken up the government in order to maintain competition. Others claim that breaking up a monopoly is a violation of the NAP. Others claim that a true monopoly is impossible as long as the corporation respects the NAP
3. Climate change: Some libertarians say that restricting a person's or business right to use fossil fuels at their own discretion is a violation of the NAP. Others claim that using fossil fuels, as it heats the environment in which everyone shares, is also a violation of the NAP.
4. Taxation: Some libertarians believe that taxation is theft and is thus morally reprehensible. Others state that taxation is evil, but is a necessary evil we must adopt out of practicality.
5. Type of Taxation: Out of some the libertarians that support a form of taxation, some proclaim a moderately progressive tax( 30%, 20% and 10% for example) is the fairest way to tax. Others claim that a completely flat tax (10% for all income earners for example) is the best way to ensure everyone pays their fair share. Others call for a regressive tax, or a tax based solely on sales tax, is the fairest.

I want to get a sense for what your priorities are, what compromises you'd accept, and just how much you'd hate me. (Also, I'm trying to order then from most to least anathema to libertarians) Anyway:

* Greatly increased tax rate, especially on the very wealthy and large corporations
* Aggressive trust-busting of large corporations to prevent monopolies/oligopolies
* Straight up nationalization or heavy subsidy/regulation of certain industries (telecommunications, power/water infrastructure.) 
* Universal single-payer healthcare
* Universal basic income
* Federal housing guarantee (Counts as some portion of UBI - if you don't claim it you get more money instead, but cost is capped relative to UBI.)
* Public higher education (Not university as it exists - focus on self-driven distance learning to reduce costs.)
* Public research funding, particularly towards projects that require enormous resources, have only long-term benefits, or would be difficult to monetize (energy research, space exploration, pure science)
* Increased environmental regulation, especially on carbon output.
* Ban on private prisons
* Limits on copyright and patent lifetimes; intellectual property enters the public domain after some number of years.
* National standards and licensing for police; replacement of most police with unarmed workers who can collect statements/issue tickets or even make willing arrests, but are not authorized to use force. (Failure to cooperate with lawful orders would be a crime, but it would be left to the actual police to enforce.)
* Greatly reduced foreign intervention, congress must declare war for hostile foreign action
* Greatly reduced military spending
* General reduction of presidential power to constitutional bounds, especially in the policy-making sphere
* Elimination of all safety net programs not listed above (unemployment, disability, food stamps). No ""Worthiness based"" programs - everyone gets every benefit. 
* Elimination of almost all employer responsibilities (no employer healthcare, no minimum wage. OSHA would probably still exist. Safety net and UBI are to ensure your life does not depend on your job, and if you have a real choice to quit your job your employer can mostly do what they want.)
* End to the war on drugs
* Restoration of 4th amendment (Also 1st and 2nd, though those seem to be in better shape)

2020-05-25,1590449933,Why Welfare and *Some* Universal Healthcare Is Moral in a Libertarian Society,"I often see other libertarians dismissing welfare or certain taxpayer funded healthcare services as immoral, the reasoning often being that if a government is moral it wouldn't tax people to redistribute wealth to those who are in poverty or pay for a doctor for people, because no one has a right to any one else's property for any reason other than the taxpayer money they use to pay for services essentially everyone agrees is in a limited form of government, courts, police, military, but not much else.

I would consider both services to be extremely similar to firefighters being paid for with taxes, something I have no problem with. If someone is in imminent danger to their health or life not because of any other person or fault of their own, whether it's because of hunger, sickness, lack of housing or a fire isn't really a major difference.

Similar to a question I posed in a thread I started in this subreddit a while back, if people only have a claim to others' property to protect them from force, violence, fraud etc. and not a right to life regardless of why they're in danger, then how do you justify the government saving peoples lives when they're stuck in a burning building? Should government firefighters only save people subject to arson, but not naturally occurring fires?

Similarly, if someone is struck with an illness because of no fault of their own, wouldn't a moral government provide the bare minimum treatment to save their life? I'm not talking about entirely universal healthcare here, literally just taxes paying for life saving medicine or surgery, which matters more, the property rights of taxpayers or the lives of a dying patient in a hospital who can't otherwise afford surgery? The same goes for basic welfare and food stamps, if someone is dying of exposure on the street, which is more important, the rights of people to some of their income or the life of a dying homeless man?

Shouldn't a limited, libertarian government system guarantee those people their lives? Or are property rights more important than their lives, so the answer is ""charity will probably solve it"" which just ignores the question, yes or no?",Libertarian,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/gqlwj0/why_welfare_and_some_universal_healthcare_is/

Step 2. 0% Tax on essential goods. 10% VAT on everything else.

Step 3. Fund a UBI/Freedom
Dividend of $1000 a month to every American with the VAT funds like Yang proposes (he has already proposed legalizing all of the above). https://youtu.be/kl39KHS07Xc

Step 4. Everyone profits. 

The money from the VAT goes back to americans as cash, no strings attached. Spend however you want.

No more food stamps/welfare, people just get cash instead to do with it what they want. A freedom dividend for living in the richest nation on the planet. Everyone gets the UBI so its fair and would have no beuracracy or potential for fraud.

Capitalism that doesnt start at zero. It would be paid for with the VAT which means that there would be 0% inflation according to every economist.

Once everyone has this financial cushion, you can slowly get rid of all the other govt beauracry and regulation and lower taxes as you get rid of all the needless govt agencies and no one would complain.

It makes more sense to legalize these things than to decriminalize them. You dont get tax revenue by only decriminalizing them and letting the drug cartels and sex traffickers continue to take the lead in selling these things.

Better to legalize and inspect the drug manufacturing process and then tax them with a 25% VAT.

You get to make sure the drugs are not contaminated with fentanyl etc.

And you get to make sure the prostitutes are not trafficking victims, are not underage, have access to police protection from abusers and access to contraception, healthcare and get regular testing for HIV and STDs.

The reason fentanyl deaths are so common is because its far far cheaper for drug cartels to make and transport 1 pound of fentanyl and mix it with 100 pounds of flour to sell as heroine than it is to make and transport 100 pounds of heroine, even after accounting for a 3% death rate among the people that use your product. Almost none of the people dying from OD realize that they are buying fentanyl mixed with other junk, they all think they are buying heroine or oxy.

The fentanyl overdoses stop if corporations that face liability make the opiates themselves using a transparent manufacturing process, and the government opens safe injection sites and adopts harm reduction policies.",Libertarian,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/eeibb2/legalize_regulate_and_tax_with_a_25_vat_weed/

I dont really see a downside to the Freedom Dividend besides the bill, but at this point all I see is that it would reduce the need for government intervention by reducing bureaucracy in cash equivalent programs like food stamps while also increasing the buying power of the bottom 90% of Americans.

2019-09-08,1567912818,"Commerce-side economics and marginal benefit rate, and vouchers too, why not","[Here's a thread about taxing sugary drinks.](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/d10n06/taxing_sweetened_drinks_by_the_amount_of_sugar/) Sin tax, like sales tax, predominantly impacts low income people. It is a regressive tax, unlike our progressive income tax system. Two things I've never understood is the whole supply-side vs demand-side economics as well as a hard limit on social benefits. Regarding subsidy to promote spending, should money go to manufacturers or consumers? Hey hey here's a concept, if you want to increase **consumer spending** then maybe **reduce the cost of consumer spending.** A great way to do this would be to get rid of the goddamn fucking sales tax. I hate the sales tax and other regressive consumption tax. I'd be good with a flat tax *rate* for income tax, but not the same tax *amount,* that's some bullshit. If you lower the cost of doing business then prices will go down and efficiency will go up, leading to a higher standard of living for all. Just think about how efficient computers have made the world more wealthy due to making it easier to conduct commerce.

The other thing is social benefits. Politicians always love to talk about ""the middle class,"" whatever the fuck that means. I think it means they can eat a dick. As we are aware, nobody loses money via income tax for getting a raise. This is because taxes are levied on a marginal rate - for example you may pay 10% on the first $20,000 you earn and 15% on the next $10,000 and so forth. However, this system does not exist for government benefits. Food stamps, medicaid, and other social benefits have a hard limit. Generally it's something like 170% of the poverty line or some bullshit number that some bureaucrat pulled out of his ass. **This means getting a raise may lose a family money.** That's fucked up, and it leads to my personal perception that **conservatives ignore the poor** while **liberals keep people poor.** I say fuck em both. Why not provide the opportunities to attain wealth instead of subsidizing extreme poverty? How about this - if you make $25,000 you get $200 in food stamps a month, so that would be $2,400. If you were on the edge of eligibility then any raise lower than $2,400 plus the new income tax liability would cause you to lose money. So if you get a $500 annual raise then you would lose 20% of the raise's benefits. As in, making $25,500 would cause you to receive $200 times 12 months minus 20% of $500 ($100) so you would receive $2,300 in food stamp benefits that year. Same thing with medicaid, we can do a sliding scale of medical subsidy so that people do not suddenly drop off in eligibility due to a raise.

Lastly, why the fuck do we not have vouchers nationwide??? Why do all these inner city schools suck and they don't implement a voucher system? Why would competition not improve the education system? How could any central bureaucrat oversee something as complex education system and put forth improvements without getting infinite pushback from invincible teachers unions? The only reliable source of judgment of a local education system is the parents whose children attend its schools. If the public school is thriving, then by all means, they will have heavy support. If it sucks donkey dick, which a lot of inner city schools do, let new private and charter schools take a crack at it. Teachers are always complaining about class sizes, well there's an easy way to fix that if you start holding public schools accountable. I think most of us in this sub can agree that no child left behind and common core are ass so just remember that old saying - all politics is local. Instead of looking to a federal administrator for sweeping blanket policy that's pretty fucking stupid how about slam down on that federalism button and let each community decide for themselves.",Libertarian,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/d15u9q/commerceside_economics_and_marginal_benefit_rate/

1. It would create an incentive to get off of food stamps, lowering government spending
2. It could actually pass Congress using the argument that it would make food stamp recipients healthier

SNAP is an interesting program. Milton Friedman advocated for allowing welfare recipients to choose how to allocate their welfare, considering they know better than the government how to meet their own wants and needs. On the other hand, providing more convenient, desirable welfare benefits will attract more people to use the program.

We could go back to literally handing out government cheese, but that seems wasteful and pointless considering there are already grocery stores that are much better at this kind of thing. A reasonable middle ground would be to restrict food stamps to being used only on essentials.

Assuming for a moment that all welfare isn't going to be eliminated anytime soon, I think we would do well to consider a UBI as a replacement for all entitlement programs. Getting rid of the government bureaucracy and 200+ government agencies is a win, and a program like this will be a trillion dollars cheaper than our current system by 2020. A trillion dollars per year saved while accomplishing a UBI.

""The UBI is to be financed by getting rid of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, housing subsidies, welfare for single women and every other kind of welfare and social-services program, as well as agricultural subsidies and corporate welfare. As of 2014, the annual cost of a UBI would have been about $200 billion cheaper than the current system.

2017-09-24,1506272528,NPR's Planet Money Episode 796 stated that some Libertarian circles support Universal Basic Income (UBI). What are your thoughts?,"Hello /r/Libertarian community,

I frequently listen to two economic podcasts -- Freakonomics Radio and Planet Money. 

I was completely taken by surprise at Planet Money's [latest episode](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/09/22/552850245/episode-796-the-basic-income-experiment) and assertion that some Libertarians support the idea of Universal Basic Income (UBI). 

For those of you who are not well-versed in UBI, it is basically free money given by the government to everyone in the country with no strings attached. That's a summarized definition given by Planet Money. However, there is no such thing as free money and there are always strings attached. 

Here is exactly what one of the hosts stated regarding our political philosophies:

**Podcast Timestamp 03:29 - 03:44:**
&gt;**A version of this concept is popular in Libertarian circles. They see basic income as a way to shrink the welfare state. For example, you could take away food stamps, Medicare, housing subsidies, and replace all of it with one flat sum.**

I oppose UBI because I follow this basic philosophy: *A person deserves nothing; a person earns everything.* Yes, exceptions can be made on a case by case basis or with people who are severely disabled, etc. But in a general sense, after age 18 where I am legally an adult in America, I should no longer be *entitled* to financial income.

2017-04-10,1491852832,Is there any room for socialism with Libertarianism?,"I consider myself a Libertarian, think that people in general making self interested decisions are better and more agile than government doing so, and am generally in favor of the government staying out of people's lives. 

So in that vein, I am all for removing minimum wage, public housing, food stamps, welfare, and most other social programs that the government pays for. Its just the government putting its finger on the scale in ways that can backfire. 

But I am also not infavor of letting people fall into a hole that they can't get out of, or die over mistakes. That's why I am for a basic minimum income. 

Before you downvote this and go to the next thread, I would be interested in why I am wrong. Here is my reasoning:

* You dont need an artificial minimum wage because people would have the money necessary to live a bare bones life (food, clothing, shelter, and a bus pass to get to job interviews). If you aren't paying enough over what they are making, then you won't get takers.
* No more housing vouchers, food stamps, welfare, etc etc etc. You can live where the market allows, and you can eat what you want based on your income. If you are willing to live in a van down by the river for a couple months to save some money, thats your prerogative. If you are willing to eat nothing but ramen so you can have a slightly better place to live, thats your choice
* People could take a chance on a long shot knowing that a mistake wouldn't sink them. Want to quit your job and open a small business? Go ahead because you know that you will have that small amount of income no matter what.

Obviously, the number would be a tricky one to define, and figure out how it should increase over time. But lets say that if we were on a lake, the rich would have yachts, middle class would have speed boats, the poor would have canoes, and the basic minimum income would basically give you a life preserver, but leave you in the water.

2017-03-21,1490120276,When did I ever agree to respect your claim to private property? You're forcing me with an end of a gun,"Libertarians often believe the social contract is bogus because they allegedly never signed a contract. Why should they pay taxes if they never signed agreement to do so? Of course, this is an extremely naïve and childish understanding of what the social contract theory actually is and how contracts themselves work in general. For example, signing up for Netflix is not the equivalent of entering into a social contract with United States civilization. Just lol. And several people, myself included, are quick to inform libertarians that if they dont agree to the terms of residency of US civilization, then they are allowed to move elsewhere to a country they deem more to their liking.

But nevertheless, this rejection of the social contract theory on this ground is interesting. Lets extend it further  why should I respect your claim to private property? Exactly when did I agree that you privately own your land? Exactly what document did I sign that stated that your Xbox belonged to you and you alone? Pick any piece of matter in existence that you foolishly claim as yours and yours only, and show me the document I signed that consented to this, and I will move on.

But of course, you cant and this conversation is silly. And if I had the power and inclination, I could take any piece of matter which you claim as your own property that I so wish. The only thing you rely on to prevent this from happening is violence and often state violence. Man, libertarians love using state violence so much, its literally obscene. 

The bottom line is that there are endless property disputes settled by the state every single year. **People have a very hard time figuring out and agreeing on who owns what.** As a civilization, we have come up with laws and guidelines to settle these disputes. Did you consent to any of them? Did I agree to the deed to your house? 

No, of course I didnt and neither did you. Society simply does not function this way. Its too complex and there are too many moving parts to have signed agreement on each interaction and transaction. 

My advice? If you like having private property, then shut up about the social contract theory and pay your fucking taxes. And while you're at it, stop using this as an excuse to defund food stamps for kids.

2012-02-15,1329323686,3 out of 3 People I know ON Government Healthcare don't want Universal Healthcare for all.,"This is why we are all screwed.   They have different idiotic reason why they don't think it would be a good idea.  It is really sometimes hard to argue with stupid people because they just believe what they believe without it being true.

For example last night my friend who has been on medicaid for most of the last 17 years (since she had her daughter), told me that Universal Health Care would not work because it is too expensive.   People wouldn't be able to survive if they have a crappy job and are mandated to pay 1/2 of their paycheck towards insurance.

While I agree they wouldn't survive if that was the case, I told her that it was highly unlikely to be that much and I am sure it would be on a sliding scale.

She said ""poor people already get medicaid"".   I told her that simply wasn't true.  She gets medicaid because she has a child under 18, but there are a lot of poor people that don't qualify for medicaid at all.

I have many poor friends who work several jobs and still can't afford insurance.   

It always seems that opposition to social programs come from people who have been on them, possibly are still on them, but don't want others to get them.

As a Social Worker I can't tell you how many stories I have heard about people driving ""Cadillac's  or SUV's"" and get food stamps.   People are always bitching about someone getting those ""food stamps"" when they aren't supposed to. 

Yeah, worry about.   Don't worry about Wall Street and the Mortgage brokers and insurance companies stealing trillions of dollars. ",progressive,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/pqum9/3_out_of_3_people_i_know_on_government_healthcare/

2015-02-16,1424129583,A Blueprint for the Progressive Movement,"If our goal is to enact real change in our nation and our world, we need a feasible plan to do so.  It's not enough to hope for a better future; we need to come up with a way to create it.

I've been chewing over an action plan for a while and I'd love to hear you guys's thoughts and feedback.  Here are the three steps I see toward creating a (more) progressive society -

1. **Get Big Money Out**.  Before we can expect our elected representatives and our media to do anything to support the advancement of humanity as a whole, we need to get them to stop working for simply selfish advancement and advancement of the few super-rich.

   *How to do it:*
   * For the US: The most realistic way of removing the influence of money in politics is to call an Article V Convention.  For this to happen, 2/3 of the state legislatures must pass a resolution calling for the convention, to which each state sends representatives, bypassing the federal government altogether.  At the convention, an amendment is debated and drafted.  Then, 3/4 of the state legislatures must vote to approve the amendment (the same as if Congress were to have drafted it).  At this point, it is coded into the Constitution.
      * [Wolf PAC](http://www.wolf-pac.com) is working hard on this issue, and we've already passed resolutions calling for a convention in three states of the necessary 34.  This is a true grassroots movement, and we need your time, support, and expertise to succeed.  Please click through to learn more.
      * There are other groups working to combat the issue of money in politics.  Some of my favorites are [Mayday PAC](https://mayday.us/) (which seeks to elect federal legislators friendly to finance reform) and [Stamp Stampede](http://www.stampstampede.org/) (which legally stamps messages on money to raise awareness of the issue.
   * The question of how to get big money out of the media that drives the opinions of our citizens is a more difficult one.  I welcome brainstorming on this issue.  The best choice at this point is to support, both monetarily and with your viewership, alternatives to the mainstream media.  Two of my favorites are [The Young Turks](https://www.tytnetwork.com/) and [Vox](http://www.vox.com/).  There are hundreds more sources, so do some research and find your favorites.  Share articles and videos from these sources on social media.  Participate in the discussions.

2. **Build a Social Safety Net**.  As automation and technology advance rapidly in the near future, the availability of traditional jobs will continue to decline rapidly.  Although the economic crisis is of course a huge factor at the moment, we are already seeing the beginnings of this phenomenon.  To protect the value and dignity of humanity, we need to create a system that ensures that every citizen (of the nation and, eventually, the world) has access to the fundamental resources that make a life worth living: food, shelter, healthcare, etc.

   *How to do it:*
   * Find or create an ideal vision of society to act as a blueprint for your social and political goals and activism.
      * [The Venus Project](https://www.thevenusproject.com/en/) is a very idealistic, but also decades-old vision of the future.  Whether or not every one of their concepts is plausible, their general aims represent very distinct and noble progressive goals to work toward.
      * The short story [Manna](http://marshallbrain.com/manna1.htm) by Marshall Brain introduces a vision of two views of this post-automated world, a dystopian and a utopian one.  The hope driving the utopian vision will help to sustain us in creating the future we dream of.
      * The book [Abundance](http://www.amazon.com/Abundance-Future-Better-Than-Think-ebook/dp/B005FLOGMM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424127458&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=abundance) by Peter Diamondis details the current and progressing technologies that will enable us to rise against humanity's greatest challenges and create abundance for all.
   * Educate people on these goals.  Keep it simple.  Meet people where they are.  Ignore the specifics, focus on their values, and find ways to tie them to the issues you care about.
      * Learn about political framing.  Read George Lakoff's [Don't Think of an Elephant](http://www.amazon.com/ALL-NEW-Dont-Think-Elephant-ebook/dp/B00NP9LHFA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424127656&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=george+lakoff).  This is essential reading for any progressive that wants to enact real societal and political change.
   * Support, elect, and educate representatives who will help us achieve these goals.  This will be infinitely easier once stage one of the plan is achieved.
      * Consider supporting Fair Voting Reform, which will allow the people more direct access to electing candidates that represent them.
      * [This collection of videos](http://www.cgpgrey.com/politics-in-the-animal-kingdom/) by CGP Grey explains in clear and convincing language and graphics what's wrong with our current voting systems, and what better alternatives exist.
      * [Fair Vote](http://www.fairvote.org/home-3/) is a group that has many arms in improving our voting system, including working toward a STV system as described in the above videos, as well as enacting Right to Vote legislation and facilitating and motivating voters in underserved communities.

3. **Anticipate, Brace For, and Welcome the Future**.  There are huge potential gains and pitfalls in the future, and it's important that we understand what we're getting into.  Being able to predict the political, social, and technological climate 1-20 years into the future will allow us to make better choices about our strategies today.

   *How to do it:*
   * Understand that history is not a straight line nor a circle, but rather a spiral - there is a quote, dubiously attributed to Mark Twain, that, ""History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes.""  Look to the past for lessons about the future - anticipate problems before they happen, and learn from the successes and failures of our ancestors.
      * I am a big proponent of the [Strauss-Howe Generational Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strauss%E2%80%93Howe_generational_theory).  They've made big predictions in the past that turned out to match very closely with how the political and social climate changed, 10 and 20 years later - predictions that very few others took seriously at the time.  Of course, they also made many incorrect or incomplete predictions (mainly about generational attitudes), which in my eyes were primarily due to them falling into the same pattern they criticized in other futurists - assuming that time is linear rather than cyclical.  Anyway, recommended books include:
      * [Generations](http://www.amazon.com/Generations-History-Americas-Future-1584/dp/0688119123/ref=la_B000AP9K4W_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424128560&amp;sr=1-2)
      * [The Fourth Turning](http://www.amazon.com/Fourth-Turning-William-Strauss-ebook/dp/B001RKFU4I/ref=la_B000AP9K4W_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424128560&amp;sr=1-1)
      * [Milennials in the Workplace](http://www.amazon.com/Millennials-Workplace-Neil-Howe/dp/0971260648/ref=la_B000AP9K4W_1_10?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424128560&amp;sr=1-10).
      * Also consider following [Neil Howe's work on Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/neilhowe/).
   * Pay attention to, educate yourself about, and be (constructively) critical about geopolitical and social predictions.  One of my favorite authors on the subject is George Friedman.  Please let me know of any you'd like to recommend!  Some books and sources:
      * [The Next 100 Years](http://www.amazon.com/Next-100-Years-Forecast-Century/dp/0767923057/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8)
      * [The Next Decade](http://www.amazon.com/Next-Decade-Where-Weve-Going-ebook/dp/B004DEPF1S/ref=la_B0045B3R32_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424128843&amp;sr=1-3)
      * [Flashpoints](http://www.amazon.com/Flashpoints-Emerging-Crisis-George-Friedman-ebook/dp/B00MDHM434/ref=la_B0045B3R32_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424128843&amp;sr=1-1)
      * Check out his and others' work at the [Stratfor](https://www.stratfor.com/) group.
   * Most importantly: understand how the advancement of technology is going to change society as we know it.  If we can get ourselves safely to the point that we develop AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), we can reasonably expect that the majority of our current concerns and worries will be obsolete (and likely replaced by a whole new set!)
      * Read parts [1](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html) and [2](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-2.html) of this excellent article by the blog Wait But Why, which details all of the issues involved in AI.
      * Follow the work of futurists and entrepreneurs: Peter Diamandis, Ray Kurzweil, Aubrey de Grey, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and so on.
      * Join us over at /r/Futurology
      * As soon as feasible, begin pushing legislators to invest in and regulate artificial intelligence research so that we develop a true self-educating AGI with people who know what they're doing (as much as possible, anyway) rather than letting someone stumble onto it.  Read the What But Why essays above to find out why this is important.

Alright, I really appreciate you all taking the time to read this!  I'd love to hear of any additions or questions you have, as well as find out more about each of your personal blueprints for creating the change you wish to see in the world.

The future is bright!  And we will build it. :)",progressive,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/2w4rbs/a_blueprint_for_the_progressive_movement/

2015-02-07,1423282826,The government must invest in its people.,"How can the government and its public servants like Congress help low-income citizens, middle class citizens and the country overall? &..By taking our tax dollars and investing it in projects that benefit local communities. These investments should be infrastructure, highways, food and work safety inspection, hospitals, homeless shelters, pet shelters, public computer labs, free computer training, business and education grants, health grants, welfare, SNAP, safety and rescue emergencies, scientific research and innovation, sex trafficking, human rights and public education investments.


These should never be cut. The health and well-being of people is too important to have a price tag. All good things are expensive at first, but over time economies of scale will improve and save tax payers money for additional projects. Many government officials are honest, hard working people that want to do good for citizens, even if unappreciated. Imagine if there were hundreds of billions of dollars invested into programs that provides learning, sick care, computer training, natural disaster relief, communication infrastructure and more.


Cost doesnt matter is that the return on investment is always greater than the initial cost. Countless families have benefited from food stamps and welfare. Their children are more likely to be successful than poor families that dont use government help.  Over time, they pay more taxes and dont commit crime thus becoming a positive return on investment. People are safer and typically happier.

2014-11-06,1415247328,The GOP Agenda,"So now that the GOP has broadened their power base by reclaiming the Senate, tightening their grip on the House, and claiming numerous Governorships, what are their plans for the next two years?

Here are some sample items culled from various GOP party platform documents which can give us some insights into their thinking. Every one of these items is a proposal from a GOP legislative  committee. 

Increasing abortion restrictions

Further attempts to repeal ""Obamacare""

Defunding the EPA

Defunding the Department of Education

Repealing significant Federal gun statutes including the removal of restrictions on waiting periods. 

Delisting assault (automatic) weapons from Federal gun law oversight.
 
Substantial increases in military funding. 

Substantial increases in funding for police militarization projects (removing restrictions for allowing police agencies to obtain military grade weapons, hardware and training). 

Massive repealing of banking regulations and regulating authority. 

Defunding the Consumer Credit Protection Agency

Defunding of federal infrastructure projects

Defunding the Department of Health and Human Services

Federal school vouchers programs

Funding reductions to social safety net programs including unemployed insurance, food stamp programs, low income housing subsidies and low interest small business loan initiatives. 

Repealing of anti-discriminatory legislation protecting the LGBT community. 

Reinstating ""don't ask / don't tell"" as a military policy. 

Repealing laws prohibiting enforced school prayer policies

Federal mandatory minimum sentencing requirements

Deregulation of the privatization of federal prisons

Repeal of federal oversight and regulatory authority for the fracking industry. 

Repeal of environmental impact regulations for the exploration and development of ""natural resources"" (gas, coal, oil, lumber, mineral rights) on public lands (national parks and preserves). 

Delisting of endangered species 

Federal criminalization of homelessness 

Further subsidies for, and deregulation of, the oil and gas industry. 

Weakening of the Clean Air and Clean Water acts. 

There are many many more but this is a representative sample of what we can look forward to over the next few years. 

I hope President Obama has his veto pen handy; he'll certainly have no lack of opportunity to use it over the remaining duration of his lame duck term.

2014-07-05,1404594853,Am I allowed to be both a progressive and a capitalist?,"While frequenting /r/progressive, I have occasionally seen articles and links highly critical of ""capitalism."" For example, articles talking about how ""21st century capitalism has failed us"" or about ""20 pernicious things you did not know about capitalism."" These posts generally have a lot of upvotes on this subreddit, reflecting a somewhat anti-capitalist sentiment. Moreover, many on this subreddit also seem to identify as  democratic socialists (I'm personally more of a social democrat).

I personally would like to view myself as a progressive: I'm very critical of the Democratic Party establishment and view President Obama as a corporatist. On social issues, civil liberties, and foreign policy, I'm definitely to the left of Obama (i'm very critical of drone strikes, the war on drugs, NSA, want handguns highly regulated, highly support affirmative action, support the voting rights act, against the militarization of the border, support immigration reform, etc). I support single-payer health care (or at least a robust public option), higher marginal taxes, more focus on income and wealth inequality, stronger regulations on Wall Street, and a more active fiscal policy to address cyclical downturns.

However, unlike many who identify as ""progressive"" on reddit, I'm a very strong and enthusiastic supporter of ""capitalism"" and a strong critic of ""socialism."" And that is because capitalism is a broad concept that encompasses many different political economic configurations, ranging from laizess-faire regulation to the highly regulated capitalist economies of western europe. What I'm against is unfettered capitalism, crony capitalism, and corporatism (such as corporate welfare, agribusiness subsidies, rent seeking by big pharma, gutting net neutrality, etc).

(Keep in mind that I'm using the definition of capitalism in Political Economy which refers to both the ownership of the factors of production and how they are distributed)

Because of my views, some people have called me a sell-out, or someone who is not a ""true progressive."" But I'd like to dispute with them what a ""true progressive"" is

I really liked the mixed economic systems of Western Europe and Scandanavia. The basic idea of the mixed economy is that the means of production are mainly under private ownership; that markets remain the dominant form of economic coordination; and that profit-seeking self-interested enterprises and the accumulation of capital remains the fundamental driving force behind economic activity. However, unlike a laissez-faire economy, the government would wield considerable indirect influence over the economy through fiscal and monetary policies designed to counteract economic downturns and capitalism's tendency toward financial crises and unemployment, along with playing a role in interventions that promote social welfare (such as food stamps, unemployment insurance, Social Security, minimum wage laws, support for collective bargaining, the EITC, and other features of a social safety net).

In general, I view capitalism as an incredibly efficient system that is excellent at allocating resources among competing uses and providing incentives for innovation, growth, dynamism, and progress. Capitalism benefits society by improving their quality of life through a higher standard of living (capitalism got western societies out of the malthusian trap). In a capitalist society, however, the most rational course of action for a self-interest person is to work and produce goods and services that others value: there's consumer sovereignty. Capitalism doesn't cause us to be self-interested, it merely acknowledges that most of us are and constructs a system in which the most rational course of action for a self-interested person is to act in ways that benefit society. Capitalism isn't evil; capitalism is honest in that regard.

Yes, there are some unfortunate byproducts of capitalism, such as inequality and creative destruction (structural unemployment resulting from workers being laid off of inefficient or unneeded industries), but the benefits strongly outweigh the costs (higher standards of living, higher levels of growth, efficient allocation of goods, innovation, entrepreneurship, etc).

I just think that the excesses of capitalism should be tamed and the government should step in where market don't work well (such as healthcare: I support ""socialized medicine"" like what exists in Western Europe). I support high levels of spending on job training, public education, childcare, etc, b/c these reduce inequality and improve equality of opportunity and upward mobility. I believe that the government should be involved in saving capitalism from itself, such as through pursuing expansionary fiscal policy during recessions, regulating the financial sector and making sure institutions aren't too large to fail, promoting alternative energy, and so forth. And I think public-private partnerships are really important: the government can enhance the free market through pro-competition regulations, providing small business loans, pursuing public-private enterprises like the national infrastructure bank, providing R&amp;D grants to companies and universities, investing in public education, and pursuing cap-and-trade to address climate change. I don't care about big government: I care about smart government. I really like Sweden's political economy: it is very pro-market in certain areas (labor unions don't have much power, labor markets are very flexible, several sectors have less regulated than America, the government doesn't own any companies, etc), but big spenders in other areas (childcare, education, healthcare, etc).

Given my views, I think it's silly to claim that you can't be a true progressive if you support capitalism. Considering that America overall is a center-right nation in an international context (and that the Democratic Party would be center-right in the Western European context), it's not unreasonable to think that even very liberal people in America still support some version of capitalism (even Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Sherrod Brown, and others don't support full on socialism: they support a mixed capitalist economy. even if Sanders calls himself a democratic socialist- he doesn't want to abolish private property or privately held businesses)

I'm also hated by the social justice warriors on tumblr who are extremely anti-capitalist and against the ""white supremacy neoliberal capitalist ableist cis-heteropatriarchy"" and some of these people also identify as progressive. So while I view myself as very liberal in the American context (socially and fiscally), I'm definitely to the right of tumblr social justice warriors and don't identify with them (yet I'd also like to consider myself a progressive when compared to establishment liberals like Obama and Hillary Clinton, and hate it when I'm criticized for not being a true progressive). To be fair, the tumblr SJWs think progressives are way too moderate for their tastes

I also disagree with the social justice warriors that patriarchy, racism, imperialism, etc are inherently tied to capitalism. I think discriminating against women or the lgbt community or against people of color HURTS capitalism b/c labor isn't allocated to where it is most suited. Therefore eliminating sexism and institutionalized racism actually helps capitalism work better.

I guess internationally I'd be more centrist or center-left

**TL;DR I support mixed economy in which social justice is pursued through a capitalist framework. The economy is still fundamentally capitalist, but the state intervenes in it and regulates it to make it more fair for its participants. I don't think you need to be ""anti-capitalist"" to be a progressive.**

2013-10-17,1382025335,What is peace?,"On the republican side of the isle
The initiation of force through the fear of safety has enabled a mass military. The US government has forced peaceful people in the United States to fund with their own incomes through taxes, a massive military interventionism overseas and at home with spy agencies. Because of a few men, hundreds of thousands of people are dead. We also know that it isn't cheap, isn't necessarily moral, and has a huge impact on the economy.

On the democrat side of the isle
The initiation of force through promises has enabled a mass welfare state to arise. Approximately 50 million people are on food stamps. Unemployment has reached over 20% if you include the people who have stopped looking for work and the people who have been long term unemployed. Taxes have increased to fund promises of pensions, wars, and welfare. Because of a few men, close to 100 million people are dependent on the government for assistance. This seems to be moral and justified, but has had a huge impact on the economy leaving us with a net increase of 8 trillion dollars in debt, and 90 trillion dollars in unfunded liabilities.

What is peace?
Peace is not being forced or coerced into making decisions that you would have otherwise not made. I am sure many of you would have not paid into the wars, but you were forced. This is not peace. I am also sure that most of you would have not given money to AIG, or bailed out multi billion dollar companies like GM, when your own parents companies were hurting just as bad and could have used the help. I am also sure that most of you would have chosen not to fund the NSA, or donated money to a multi million dollar vacation for a politician, when it is hard enough for you to find the time and money to even take a $500 vacation. Both parties are guilty, and it is time to use common sense logic to change this.

What does keeping your paycheck mean?
In essence, keeping your paycheck means that you can choose to allocate your money in the places in society where you see fit. It ensures that congress is not bought by corporations receiving special interests. It means that while your family business is failing, you can spend your money to bail them out, rather then bailing out a mega corporation. It means that the federal reserve will not be allowed to devalue the money that you make. If you make minimum wage, and the fed devalues the dollar, then by the time you get home from work, the minimum wage that you make is actually less than minimum wage. We are all being cheated.

Solution?
The solution is as simple as being able to keep your own paycheck, and allocate funds to where you would like them to go. Yes, that does mean that people with more money. However, they will have more power to open up new businesses or donate to causes like many mega rich philanthropists are doing. We should all understand that corporations may seem like they are paying you fair, but they are really in congress trying to raise your taxes, so that they can get a hold of the taxes. The only way to stop this is from happening is to decrease the size of the government, which is to increase the amount of take home income that YOU can use for your cause. By growing the government, you are taking your ability to reason, and voting for someone that does not share 100% common beliefs as you. This means, that you are trading your own reasoning ability and giving a few people the ability to reason for the masses. As we have seen, this is resulting in mass poverty, unemployment, debt, and wars. 

My proposition
Please think twice before handing over your brain on a silver platter to the government. Think wise and make your own decisions. You can vote to give them more power over your decision making, but that is only going to mean that you will be using less of your brain, and depending on them to make the decisions that you could have made, had the power been in your hands. Please return the power to yourselves instead of an elite few in our ever growing crony capitalist system.

2013-04-11,1365642124,Rabbi Steven Pruzansky discusses the current state of the United States of America,"Please take a moment to digest this provocative article by a Rabbi from Teaneck, N.J. It is far and away the most succinct and thoughtful explanation of how our nation is changing. The article appeared in The Israel National News, and is directed to Jewish readership. 70% of American Jews vote as Democrats. The Rabbi has some interesting comments in that regard.

Rabbi Steven Pruzansky is the spiritual leader of Congregation Bnai Yeshurun in Teaneck, New Jersey.

The most charitable way of explaining the election results of 2012 is that Americans voted for the status quo  for the incumbent President and for a divided Congress. They must enjoy gridlock, partisanship, incompetence, economic stagnation and avoidance of responsibility.

And fewer people voted.

But as we awake from the nightmare, it is important to eschew the facile explanations for the Romney defeat that will prevail among the chattering classes. Romney did not lose because of the effects of Hurricane Sandy that devastated this area, nor did he lose because he ran a poor campaign, nor did he lose because the Republicans could have chosen better candidates, nor did he lose because Obama benefited from a slight uptick in the economy due to the business cycle.

Romney lost because he didnt get enough votes to win.

That might seem obvious, but not for the obvious reasons. Romney lost because the conservative virtues  the traditional American virtues  of liberty, hard work, free enterprise, private initiative and aspirations to moral greatness  no longer inspire or animate a majority of the electorate.

The simplest reason why Romney lost was because it is impossible to compete against free stuff.

Every businessman knows this; that is why the loss leader or the giveaway is such a powerful marketing tool. Obamas America is one in which free stuff is given away: the adults among the 47,000,000 on food stamps clearly recognized for whom they should vote, and so they did, by the tens of millions; those who  courtesy of Obama  receive two full years of unemployment benefits (which, of course, both disincentivizes looking for work and also motivates people to work off the books while collecting their windfall) surely know for whom to vote. The lure of free stuff is irresistible.

The defining moment of the whole campaign was the revelation of the secretly-recorded video in which Romney acknowledged the difficulty of winning an election in which 47% of the people start off against him because they pay no taxes and just receive money  free stuff  from the government. Almost half of the population has no skin in the game  they dont care about high taxes, promoting business, or creating jobs, nor do they care that the money for their free stuff is being borrowed from their children and from the Chinese. They just want the free stuff that comes their way at someone elses expense. In the end, that 47% leaves very little margin for error for any Republican, and does not bode well for the future.

It is impossible to imagine a conservative candidate winning against such overwhelming odds. People do vote their pocketbooks. In essence, the people vote for a Congress who will not raise their taxes, and for a President who will give them free stuff, never mind who has to pay for it.

That engenders the second reason why Romney lost: the inescapable conclusion that the electorate is ignorant and uninformed. Indeed, it does not pay to be an informed voter, because most other voters  the clear majority  are unintelligent and easily swayed by emotion and raw populism.

That is the indelicate way of saying that too many people vote with their hearts and not their heads. That is why Obama did not have to produce a second term agenda, or even defend his first-term record. He needed only to portray Mitt Romney as a rapacious capitalist who throws elderly women over a cliff, when he is not just snatching away their cancer medication, while starving the poor and cutting taxes for the rich.

During his 1956 presidential campaign, a woman called out to Adlai Stevenson: Senator, you have the vote of every thinking person!

Stevenson called back: Thats not enough, madam, we need a majority!

Truer words were never spoken.

Obama could get away with saying that Romney wants the rich to play by a different set of rules  without ever defining what those different rules were; with saying that the rich should pay their fair share  without ever defining what a fair share is; with saying that Romney wants the poor, elderly and sick to fend for themselves  without even acknowledging that all these government programs are going bankrupt, their current insolvency only papered over by deficit spending.

Similarly, Obama (or his surrogates) could hint to blacks that a Romney victory would lead them back into chains and proclaim to women that their abortions and birth control would be taken away. He could appeal to Hispanics that Romney would have them all arrested and shipped to Mexico and unabashedly state that he will not enforce the current immigration laws.

He could espouse the furtherance of the incestuous relationship between governments and unions  in which politicians ply the unions with public money, in exchange for which the unions provide the politicians with votes, in exchange for which the politicians provide more money and the unions provide more votes, etc., even though the money is gone.

Obama also knows that the electorate has changed  that whites will soon be a minority in America (theyre already a minority in California) and that the new immigrants to the US are primarily from the Third World and do not share the traditional American values that attracted immigrants in the 19th and 20th centuries.

It is a different world, and a different America. Obama is part of that different America, knows it, and knows how to tap into it. That is why he won.

Obama also proved again that negative advertising works, invective sells, and harsh personal attacks succeed. That Romney never engaged in such diatribes points to his essential goodness as a person; his negative ads were simple facts, never personal abuse  facts about high unemployment, lower take-home pay, a loss of American power and prestige abroad, a lack of leadership, etc.

As a politician, though, Romney failed because he did not embrace the devils bargain of making unsustainable promises. It turned out that it was not possible for Romney and Ryan  people of substance, depth and ideas  to compete with the shallow populism and platitudes of their opponents.

Obama mastered the politics of envy  of class warfare  never reaching out to Americans as such but to individual groups, and cobbling together a winning majority from these minority groups.

If an Obama could not be defeated  with his record and his vision of America, in which free stuff seduces voters  it is hard to envision any change in the future.

The road to Hillary Clinton in 2016 and to a European-socialist economy  those very economies that are collapsing today in Europe  is paved.

For Jews, mostly assimilated anyway and staunch Democrats, the results demonstrate again that liberalism is their Torah. Almost 70% voted for a president widely perceived by Israelis and most committed Jews as hostile to Israel. They voted to secure Obamas future at Americas expense and at Israels expense  in effect, preferring Obama to Netanyahu by a wide margin.

A dangerous time is ahead. Under present circumstances, it is inconceivable that the US will take any aggressive action against Iran and will more likely thwart any Israeli initiative. The US will preach the importance of negotiations up until the production of the first Iranian nuclear weapon  and then state that the world must learn to live with this new reality.

But this election should be a wake-up call to Jews. There is no permanent empire, nor is there an enduring haven for Jews anywhere in the exile.

The American empire began to decline in 2007, and the deterioration has been exacerbated in the last five years. This election only hastens that decline. Society is permeated with sloth, greed, envy and materialistic excess. It has lost its moorings and its moral foundations. The takers outnumber the givers, and that will only increase in years to come.

The Occupy riots across this country in the last two years were mere dress rehearsals for what lies ahead  years of unrest sparked by the increasing discontent of the unsuccessful who want to seize the fruits and the bounty of the successful, and do not appreciate the slow pace of redistribution.

If this election proves one thing, it is that the Old America is gone. And, sad for the world, it is not coming back.",democrats,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/1c3r8e/rabbi_steven_pruzansky_discusses_the_current/
2012-06-21,1340246280,Response to Republican friend's fb post?,"I live in a tiny conservative Texas town.  I'm used to seeing all sorts of nasty things on people's facebook status but one I saw today just rubbed me the wrong way.  It's a friend's mom.  I think what got to me is the self-righteousness of the post.  

Her post just said ""I support helping the needy.  I oppose funding the lazy.""  The post has over a dozen likes from her friends already.

I volunteer at a food pantry helping people fill out the paperwork they need to get their SNAP/TANF/WIC benefits.  Everybody I help is always so embarrassed to be receiving public assistance and grateful for the help.  None of them see it as a permanent solution.

I know there is nothing I can do or say to completely change her outlook.  But is there something I can tell her to get her to start thinking a little differently?  I'm sure her and her friends think everyone on food stamps is a mooching welfare queen or something.  Is there a study I can link to that shows that this isn't the case? 

She has a son with a new baby.  Can't she picture what would happen to them if he lost his job? Wouldn't she want well funded programs in place?  

Also, if I'm overreacting I don't mind just deleting her from my fb friendship/hiding her posts.  Just wanted to know if there was something yall could think of for me to put. ",democrats,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/vd1q9/response_to_republican_friends_fb_post/

2023-05-31,1685506445,Joe Biden and Steve Ricchetti are master-negotiators and have pulled of the deal of the century,"**In an extremely difficult negotiation situation where republicans were using almost terrorist tactics by holding the economy hostage:**

* Biden got McCarthy to not only agree on a debt ceiling deal this time, but eliminated having to do it again next year. He demanded and got a two year deal

* He not only got McCarthy to agree to raise the debt ceiling, but to eliminate the ceiling altogether for those two years.

* Biden used the debt ceiling negotiations to strike a deal on the annual budget negotiations which would have had to be completed by October 1st. 

* He has basically made three deals in one:

1: ----------This years debt ceiling deal

2: ----------This years budget negotiation

3: ----------Next years debt ceiling deal


* The $80 billion for the IRS which Kevin McCarthy and the GOP demanded be eliminated, was only reduced to $70 billion which is still the largest increase to the agency in history

* Then Biden will take that $10 billion and spread it across areas of so-called spending cuts to neutralize those spending cuts.

* It appears that  Biden has let them cut food stamps but in reality he got more money and more people will be covered

* Republicans had demanded 18% spending cuts across the board in all government programs except the military. They got none of that.

* And though Biden is clearly the winner in this battle, he can not claim victory yet&, (yet being the key word). Otherwise the republicans may change their mind on voting for it. He is clearly letting them think they won. Well at least that they didnt lose.

* Biden made it appear McCarthy had a victory by forcing Biden to negotiate. And got republicans to believe that.  In reality they got nothing. They only achieved the appearance of a win. Biden didnt care how it made him look. He just gave McCarthy something to claim as a win.

**And just a couple hours ago, the House Rules Committee controlled by republicans voted 7-6 to allow the deal to be voted on tomorrow.**

As a personal guess, I think a secret deal made have been made to have democrats save McCarthy from getting voted out in the battle that will most definitely occur after the deal is passed. I have no evidence to support this. It's just my prediction.

Occassionally takes to Twitter to post anti-Semitic conspiracy theories

He took the time to discredit Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post journalist who was dismemebered by a hacksaw before he actually died, by Jared Kushner's buddies https://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2018/10/18/florida-rep-matt-gaetz-is-a-terrible-person

He shared a video, with zero context or background, showing a random person handing cash to people in a crowd. He then recklessly questioned if this was another effort from Jewish billionaire George Soros,

Gaetz's aides once wrote a bill with help from a conspiracy theory subreddit devoted to white nationalism--Wired later discovered that a Gaetz staffer had crowdsourced ideas for the amendment on a subReddit forum which happens to be a cesspool of alt-right activity https://www.wired.com/story/republican-staffer-the-donald-resolution/

Gaetzs record reveals arrests for drunk driving --He didn't have his license suspended for a year when he refused the breath test  as Florida law dictates. And he didn't have that refusal used against him in a criminal proceeding. Charges against Gaetz were dismissed after events that included, among other things, the forced resignation of the arresting officer. https://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/lawmakers-talk-of-mug-shot-raises-questions-about-dui-arrest/2166023/

Matt Gaetz Voted Against Paid Sick Leave in Florida But Takes Paid Leave From Congress 

In the late 1970s, Matt Gaetz's father co-founded a nonprofit hospice company, Vitas which they sold in 2004, In 2013, the Justice Department sued Vitas, alleging that between 2002 and 2013, the company had defrauded Medicare by filing false claims for services never provided or for patients who werent terminally ill. The company settled the case in 2017 for more than $75 million, at the time the largest settlement ever recovered from a hospice company. 

House Speaker Ray Sansom, a friend of Don Gaetz for whom Matt had worked as a legislative aide during law school. In April 2009, Sansom was indicted on corruption charges, accused of tweaking the state budget to funnel more than $25 million to Northwest Florida State College in Niceville. Of those funds, $6 million was earmarked to build a hangar at the Destin airport for a jet company owned by one of Sansoms friends and donors, real estate developer Jay Odom. Odom was also a client of Matt Gaetz, who handled Odoms hangar lease. (In 2013, Odom would be sentenced to six months in prison for illegally funneling $23,000 into former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabees failed 2008 presidential campaign. In the past decade, Odom has contributed thousands of dollars to Gaetzs political campaigns https://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/legislature/florida-rep-matt-gaetz-stands-his-ground-in-defense-of-controversial-law/2151199/

Don Gaetz, routinely wrote articles for the Pensacola News Journal but quit on the grounds that the paper was too mean to his son, Matt Gaetz 

3 months before declaring his candidacy for the state House, he sued Valparaiso on behalf of Okaloosa County and argued publicly that the citys opposition could sink the F-35 program. In reality, the program couldnt be reversed without an act of Congress. Gaetzs lawsuit went nowhere. It was a big waste of time and money, but it got him in the paper, 

Matt Gaetz co-sponsored bill to abolish the department of education 

A group of students from the University of West Florida, joining the schools faculty, are calling on the universitys board of trustees to not choose Florida state Senator Don Gaetz--Matt Gaetz's father. as the institutions sixth president. 

Where did Matt Gaetz come up with all that money to run for congress? The obvious suspect was his dad. It would have been illegal for Don Gaetz to lend six figures to the campaign, but he appears to have found another way to funnel money to his sons race.Matt Gaetz sold a house he owned for just under $100,000. Three months later, he sold several vacant lots hed bought years earlier. All of Gaetzs real estate was purchased by the same buyer: a company called Treveron, which, it turns out, is owned by his dad.

2018-10-22,1540252675,Pro-Choice is the Only Choice,"This one might ruffle some feathers, but lets give it a try. If you want a society with fewer abortions, your only choice is to vote for Democrats. That is the only party with a platform that will actually reduce the number of abortions - access to birth control, comprehensive sex education, expanding access to health care like Planned Parenthood (most importantly prenatal care), even affordable education and early childcare/welfare/food stamps to provide economic assistance after birth make a huge impact on the frequency of abortions. Not coincidentally, these are the planks of the Democratic platform. 

The Republican answer is to simply ban the medical practice, which doesnt prevent abortions but makes them less safe for the mothers. Outlawing abortions also fails to acknowledge the instances in which abortions are a medical necessity or the least bad of two choices. Its not a good choice, but is one that many hopeful mothers are forced to make - when the genetic or ultrasound tests show that the fetus will not survive the pregnancy or the birth. It is a terrible decision but one that a mother/father must make with the physician.  Sometimes that heartbreaking choice is not available until after 20 weeks. The Republicans insert themselves between a women and her OB/GYN with unnecessary testing and sometimes force the physician to lie. 

I understand that some people see this as a black and white issue, but as with most things in life, the practice is quite gray. There are legitimate, medical reasons for abortions or induced miscarriages, and they are all sad and terrible. Even if there wasnt a medical reason, this should be a decision a woman gets to make for her own self, her own body. The answer isnt to make the women criminals or punish the physicians. The answer is to make the practice an unnecessary as possible and that is where Democratic policies win the argument hands down.

2017-05-26,1495802084,Trump's voters who voted for him overwhelmingly thinking he got their back must come to their senses right now because Trump's budget does nothing for them. But help the billionaires like him with no 'estate taxes'.,"If Trump's voters don't realize even now at this very late stage of their doomsday that Trump is deliberately creating to help only rich billionaires  like him, then most of those Trump's voters who trusted his every words in his rallies and Campaign stops will really be sucker punched, pun not intended here, by the same man who literally promised them the moon on a platter.

Since Trump became the president in a treacherous way all our nation's founders are not only shaking their heads in their graves but trying to fake amnesia thinking ""No, we didn't give this nation to our people so that just one president called bloody Trump could screw up the country for the entire generations to come later on"". 

It also seems like Trump, who was always very shrewd and cunning and also a person of depraved and prejudiced mind since his younger days, really suffers from acute amnesia or most probably fakes it most of the time.

Otherwise how come a candidate, who lied through his 'pants on fire' scenarios like promising what he'd do for the very people who were flocking to his ""carnival barker show"", is now literally stabbing  those very people's hearts with economical daggers who really thought they found their messiah in Trump who promised to clean the Swamp in Washington.

Instead Trump created more swamps in our nation's capital by selecting billionaires in his cabinet and allowing all the special interest groups and lobbyists to cut deals with him and all the Republican lawmakers like never before.

The ""93 percent White"" population of West Virginia as mentioned in an article in NYT today, who're suffering immensely because of all the coal mining jobs lost due to automation and not definitely because of Obama's neglects as Trump alleged, will be the most affected by Trump's budget as he'll take away everything from them that they're depending on with '29% on Medicaid, and almost 19% on food stamps.
 
With 'more than 4% of the population of WV, the highest in the nation, receiving Social Security disability payments partly because of the legacy of unhealthy working conditions, partly because of their innocence as well as because a high fraction of the population who suffer from chronic diseases, like diabetics', will suffer terribly if Trump has his way with his very destructive budget that he presented to the Congress' as per the same NYT article .

But I really don't understand the arguments for a $15 minimum wage. That equates to just over $31,000, which is more than is necessary to survive in moderate comfort. I've heard the argument that the current minimum wage is not enough to support a family; but minimum wage was never intended to do such a thing. I fully understand that a family of four, of which two parents make minimum wage (current rate) would have a very difficult time getting by. But isn't this why we have food stamps/welfare (policies I'm a huge supporter of)? Although it is not the norm, there are many well-educated, working professionals who make less than $15/hour or $31,200. Should salaried workers making less than this also get a raise? Should we have a minimum salary law as well?

If literally everyone in America went to college, we would still have just as many Americans working minimum wage jobs. There are already more college students out there than there are jobs that pay well and require a college education (with the exception of some fields like nursing which apparently need people; I think fields like that should be pushed really hard by college advisers).


If everyone in America had a bachelor's degree, then a bachelor's degree would be required to deliver pizzas while a PhD would be required for any job that currently requires a bachelor's degree. A bachelor's degree would become the new high school diploma (shit, it already has). We would have a nation of people delivering your pizzas and making your cheeseburgers who feel they are entitled to a better job due to their degree and the fact that everyone told them growing up that a college degree was needed so they wouldn't have to grow up flipping burgers. There are already a crazy amount of people delivering your pizzas who have degrees. And on top of everything, they have student loan debt.


Why am I typing all of this? Because these are the things you should think about the next time you bitch about raising the minimum wage. This is what you should think about the next time you say ""Minimum wage jobs aren't meant to raise a family; if you want to get paid well, go to college."" There are a finite amount of high-paying jobs out there and way too many people needing them. There are people out there trying to raise children (in some cases because their religion told them birth control wasn't an option) who can't afford it. We are a civilized society and letting children starve to death is NOT AN OPTION. Also not an option is expecting every poor family to give up their kids for adoption so a rich family can take them on (plus not every family who adopts a kid is rich). You have a poor family who's provider is uneducated and we can't expect EVERYONE like this to go to college; there are two options: 1) Welfare, food stamps, etc. 2) Raise the fucking minimum wage to an acceptable level. CHOOSE ONE OF THOSE TWO, because option 3 is letting children starve to death, and that is NOT AN OPTION.",democrats,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/1wkirf/raise_the_minimum_wage_because_college_isnt/

2018-10-23,1540255278,Pro-Choice is the Only Choice,"This one might ruffle some feathers, but lets give it a try. If you want a society with fewer abortions, your only choice is to vote for Democrats. That is the only party with a platform that will actually reduce the number of abortions - access to birth control, comprehensive sex education, expanding access to health care like Planned Parenthood (most importantly prenatal care), even affordable education and early childcare/welfare/food stamps to provide economic assistance after birth make a huge impact on the frequency of abortions. Not coincidentally, these are the planks of the Democratic platform.

The Republican answer is to simply ban the medical practice, which doesnt prevent abortions but makes them less safe for the mothers. Outlawing abortions also fails to acknowledge the instances in which abortions are a medical necessity or the least bad of two choices. Its not a good choice, but is one that many hopeful mothers are forced to make - when the genetic or ultrasound tests show that the fetus will not survive the pregnancy or the birth. It is a terrible decision but one that a mother/father must make with the physician. Sometimes that heartbreaking choice is not available until after 20 weeks. The Republicans insert themselves between a women and her OB/GYN with unnecessary testing and sometimes force the physician to lie.

I understand that some people see this as a black and white issue, but as with most things in life, the practice is quite gray. There are legitimate, medical reasons for abortions or induced miscarriages, and they are all sad and terrible. If if there wasnt a medical reason, this should be a decision a woman gets to make for her own self, her own body. The answer isnt to make the women criminals or punish the physicians. The answer is to make the practice an unnecessary as possible and that is where Democratic policies win the argument hands down.",Liberal,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/9qjuz2/prochoice_is_the_only_choice/

I grew up in a democrat household, my mother being heavily into politics in our town and my father a black man who grew up around racism his whole life down south.  

So I was raised Democrat by my family never ""pushed"" me into it, I naturally adopted their world views until I went to college.  Then after I started my business did I slowly turn conservative on many issues.

My real question is this.  How much ""social welfare"" and taxes do Liberals believe we need in America?  Even in its current form before Obamacare is full enacted, America provides a ton of social programs already.  

I am not heartless, I want people to have fallback options that help them get back on their feet, but I want those options to be painful and uncomfortable.  You would get the basic necessities in my world, enough to survive but not enough to make you ""happy"".  

I want you as an American to strive for something better.  To be rewarded for your hard work with the fruits of your labor.  If everyone gets the same thing no matter their work effort, you remove a huge incentive for people to strive for something better. 

Watching this entire healthcare debate really has me believing that your world view dictates there will never be enough welfare until everyone is equal.

Please help me analyze facts vs. fiction.","I received this email forward from my uncle, about welfare abuse.  The email has an image of a newspaper obituary, and then proceeds to rant about welfare abuse, using random capitalization, colors, underlining, etc., to try and sell the ultimate argument that it is people like this deceased person, and his abundant procreation, that are bankrupting America.  

I figured this would be a good time to post about welfare abuse, because I've recently found myself in arguments with Conservatives about which spending programs in society, are responsible for our national debt, with them often citing ""welfare abuse"" as a reason, while I often counter with military spending, corporate tax evasion, etc.  

I am asking you all to help me critique this, so that we can generate a list of facts, to arm ourselves when we get into these arguments.  I personally feel that everyone should work, and that welfare abuse is wrong, but, the research I've done indicates there is reason to believe that it is far from the worst spending program causing national debt.

To start, I note that there are no facts provided.  It doesn't even say in the obituary that these people were on welfare; it is simply presumed (I guess because the deceased was a minority).  But even if the assertions are true, it does not cite any sources where the person obtained their data, to compute these numbers.  It then also assumes that all thirteen of the deceased's siblings are going to have nine children each, collecting maximum benefits!

Please help me critique this with facts and figures, if available.  Keep the discussion academic.  I will provide some facts and figures that I've found, as the discussion progresses.



Now, the text from the email (I've blocked out the names, because they are not relevant.  The graphic of the obituary is omitted, but, it is not necessary in the debate; the rant of the person who created this email provides enough):

***************************************************

**Subject:** Learning from Obituaries....

It seems that every couple of days New Orleans loses one of its treasured ENTREPRENEURS.

(Photo of obituary showing a picture of a man, followed by text, saying he died at age 25, and lists his survivors)

Lets get the players straight before we go on with this.. 

(Deceased's name with nickname in quotes)

His Companion:  (Name listed)

His Sons : (Three names listed)

His Daughters: (Six names listed)

AT AGE 25 - He had 9 Children.


His Father:  (Name listed)
His Mother: (Name listed)
His Stepfather: (Name listed)


His Brothers: (Eight names listed)

His Sisters: (Five names listed)

Grandparents: (Four names listed)

GOT THE ABOVE ALL STRAIGHT? 

NOW, THE REST OF THE STORY 

He was 25 and had 3 sons and 6 daughters. 
NINE welfare recipients collecting$950 each.....
That equals $8,550 a month !!! Now add

Food Stamps, 
Free medical, Free school lunches,

and on and on

Do the math...$102,000+ /year.

Anyone out there, sittin' on their butt while reading this e-mail, making

A HUNDRED GRAND doing nothing? 

Now that, to me, is a real Entrepreneur.

(ALSO, BECAUSE OF THEIR FATHERS DEATH, ALL OF THE KIDS WILL COLLECT
SOCIAL SECURITY UNTIL THEY ARE 18)

EVEN BETTER...IF (Nickname)'s

THIRTEEN BROTHERS &amp; SISTERS

FOLLOWED HIS ENTREPRENEURIAL

STRATEGY--THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL

$1.3 MILLION PER YEAR

BUT WAIT...THERE'S MORE!

IF ALL THIRTEEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS CAN

DUPLICATE HIS FEAT OF 9 WELFARE STRATEGISTS

THAT BREEDS 117 NEW RECIPIENTS COLLECTING $100,000/YR!!...OR AN ADDITIONAL

$11,700,000PER YEAR...

&amp;THAT'S ONE DAMN FAMILY

(And demands 100% the Taxes Paid by 1,000avg. taxpayers)

And THAT is why this once great country is

BANKRUPT!!

ANY QUESTIONS?

2012-04-10,1334096847,My brother-in-law is a racist and a hypocrite.,"At an Easter shindig at my grandparents' farm, I was talking to my brother-in-law about bikes, since his son is learning how to ride one. I told him that I was going to bring my old bike back to campus with me. I also mentioned that I would have to get a bike lock, at which point he adds, ""Yeah, you don't want some towelhead running off with it.""

FYI, everyone in our combined family is white. I've also had plenty of experiences with his casual racism, so I said, ""Really, Doug? You gotta do that?"" I go on to explain to him that since most of the international students (and really, anyone who's been in school longer than two years) live off-campus, the most likely bike thief I would encounter is a douchey white guy. So he says, ""A white guy's not gonna steal your bike. They're too lazy.""

Then he goes on to complain about 'foreigners' and how they hate on the government while still leeching off of it. I tell him that I'm pretty sure if such a person did complain like that, they probably wouldn't come to the US. He says something about coming for work and then going back home and just moving back and forth like that. Never mind the fact that international students, the group we were initially discussing, are typically documented immigrants.

Finally, I go, ""You're one to talk about 'leeching off the government', since if I recall correctly, you were on food stamps a couple of years ago."" Then he says, ""Yeah, but I'm an American. I was born here.""

I just walked away because WTF AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY TO THAT??! ",Liberal,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/s3apz/my_brotherinlaw_is_a_racist_and_a_hypocrite/
