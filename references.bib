  abstract = {The field of writing analytics is currently in a state of growth, redefinition, and refinement. In this essay, I review the trajectory of a related subfield, text-as-data in political science, as a lens through which to understand the present and future of writing analytics. I first describe how text-as-data has evolved over several eras, before transitioning to a review of some of the most exciting contemporary areas of political text-as-data. I then draw parallels between these developments and the work being done by the community of writing analytics scholars across the globe. I conclude by proposing several considerations for current practitioners seeking to emulate the ``success story'' of political text-as-data, including investment in the collection of new, high-quality corpora, development of shareable and open-source methodological tools for text analysis, and the strengthening of a community of scholarship.},

In particular, the field has not empirically analyzed the titles of publications within our discipline. Such empirical study can present a clearer picture of how our field has evolved and what are the theoretical and practical tenets of our discipline. In this study, we begin to explore these issues. First, in a corpus that includes the title of every article published in the five major technical communication scholarly publications and the one trade publication between 1996 and 2013, we determine what the most common words used within titles are. We then determine what words are unique to scholarly publications or trade publications. Finally, we explore how the common words have changed over time.},

  abstract = {Climate scientists overwhelmingly agree that the Earth is getting warmer and that the rise in average global temperature is predominantly due to human activity. Yet a significant proportion of the American public, as well as a considerable number of legislators in the U.S. Congress, continue to reject the ``consensus view.'' While the source of the disagreement is varied, one prominent explanation centres on the activities of a coordinated and well-funded countermovement of climate sceptics. This study contributes to the literature on organized climate scepticism by providing the first systematic overview of conservative think tank sceptical discourse in nearly 15 years. Specifically, we (1) compile the largest corpus of contrarian literature to date, collecting over 16,000 documents from 19 organizations over the period 1998\textendash 2013; (2) introduce a methodology to measure key themes in the corpus which scales to the substantial increase in content generated by conservative think tanks over the past decade; and (3) leverage this new methodology to shed light on the relative prevalence of science- and policy-related discussion among conservative think tanks. We find little support for the claim that ``the era of science denial is over''\textemdash instead, discussion of climate science has generally increased over the sample period. \ss{} 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The era of Big Data has begun. Computer scientists, physicists, economists, mathematicians, political scientists, bio-informaticists, sociologists, and other scholars are clamoring for access to the massive quantities of information produced by and about people, things, and their interactions. Diverse groups argue about the potential benefits and costs of analyzing genetic sequences, social media interactions, health records, phone logs, government records, and other digital traces left by people. Significant questions emerge. Will large-scale search data help us create better tools, services, and public goods? Or will it usher in a new wave of privacy incursions and invasive marketing? Will data analytics help us understand online communities and political movements? Or will it be used to track protesters and suppress speech? Will it transform how we study human communication and culture, or narrow the palette of research options and alter what `research' means? Given the rise of Big Data as a socio-technical phenomenon, we argue that it is necessary to critically interrogate its assumptions and biases. In this article, we offer six provocations to spark conversations about the issues of Big Data: a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon that rests on the interplay of technology, analysis, and mythology that provokes extensive utopian and dystopian rhetoric.},

  abstract = {When conducting social media research, scholars inherently examine people's personal lives due to the nature of social media engagement. While some social media platforms allow for efforts of anonymity to be made, due to facial recognition software and other technologies it can be difficult to truly be anonymous online as one shares details and photos from their lived experiences. Digital research ethics in the field currently advocate for a situational approach to inquiry rather than providing rigid rules and frameworks. However, I argue social media scholars need a more comprehensive research ethic, namely an ethic of care, when studying content so intimately tied to people's lives. Drawing on digital research and feminist ethics, social media research guidelines from the Association of Internet Researchers, and on my experiences studying embodied performances on social media, I propose a feminist digital research ethic of care that further prioritizes the safety and care of those being studied due to the ease of searching and finding people online. Adopting more comprehensive ethics when conducting social media research becomes especially important when studying minority and vulnerable populations, such as may be the case when conducting social media research tied to gender, sexuality, and the LGBTQIA+community.},

  abstract = {The rise of digital humanities has led many writing researchers to consider using digital tools to analyze rhetorical patterns in text. Yet taking a digital approach to the analysis of texts is a complex task. We are faced with a variety of techniques and tools, all of which require' significant investment to learn and use. How can we best understand the costs and benefits of adopting a particular approach? Are they simply alternatives or can they be integrated? The three sets of authors in this special section attempt to address these questions by using alternative methodologies to analyze a common set of documents. The following opening piece serves as an introduction to the project. In it, we place their research in the context of taxonomy of approaches to text analysis, and review prior attempts at integration. Following the articles, a closing piece examines the prospects for integration. In it, we provide a brief review of the results of the analyses followed by an examination of their commonalities and variations. Finally, w e conclude with the considerations that should be taken into account in choosing a method for textual analysis, as well as a discussion of the potential for an integration of methods. \textcopyright{} Earli.},

Using a corpus of 1,467 articles and essays published in the New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of the American Medical Association between 1959 and May 2019, this study evaluates diachronic shifts in (a) the framing of opioid pharmacology, (b) the relative attention paid to pain management versus opioid dependence risks, and (c) the distribution of statements related to physicians' primary ethical obligations. The results of these analyses largely disconfirm different current accounts of shifting physician rhetoric around opioids and pain management leading up to the recognition opioid epidemic. Most notably, the results also suggest that biomedical debates surrounding opioids are serving as proxy arguments for shifting primary bioethical obligations from individual patients to public health.},

  abstract = {Purpose: This case history reports on the process of developing a method to identify, extract, and clean string citation data from a corpus of articles to assist future studies on research methods, especially those relating citation metrics to diversity and inclusion efforts in technical communication. Method: We developed a theory-to-query method that uses a theoretical framework, computer logic, and collaborative research design to create a custom computer program to extract data from a large corpus of text. This research method uses an iterative approach involving both human and computer analysis to complete the necessary tasks. Results: Although we successfully created a custom computer program to parse citations, both human and computer analysis were needed to effectively extract data from the corpus. The allocation of labor (human vs. computer) was driven by the limitations of the data as well as by the limitations of human and computer abilities, rather than the type of task (e.g., repetitive, requiring pattern recognition). Conclusion: Interdisciplinary partners should use a framework to communicate effectively in their design process to better refine a project's scope, overcome unexpected limitations, and troubleshoot. Theory-to-query is a method that combines theoretical frameworks, computer logic, and collaborative research design to create custom programs that aid analysis, such as designing a program for extracting citations from a corpus of journal articles. However, even with detailed plans and clear communication, design processes require iteration and creativity as new limitations for both human and computer analysis are identified.},

Our paper discusses the creation of a prototype web application, "Use What You Choose" (UWYC), which sorts the natural language text of Amazon reviews into two categories: instructionally-weighed reviews (e.g., reviews that contain operational information about products) and non-instructionally-weighed reviews (those that evaluate the quality of the product). Our results contribute to rhetorical genre theory and offer ideas on applying genre theory to inform application design for users of information services.},

In this citational analysis, we suggest that the limited citation of Black women should be interrogated and redressed as a form of inequity. Framing this project within the politics of citation and the current campaign to \#CiteBlackWomen, we work to explore how the term ``intersectional'' has been embraced, whose theories have been adopted, ignored, and replicated, and question the lack of a strong, central foundation of Black woman scholars and theorists. We situate our study alongside the complex theoretical treatments of intersectionality in Hill Collins, Hancock, and other treatises that tie intersectionality to oppression rather than identity. We make recommendations that address the politics of citations within engineering education as the field continues to address issues of social justice, equity and inclusion.},

  abstract = {Individual's privacy, especially with regard to their personal data, is increasingly an area of concern as people interact with a wider and more pervasive set of digital services. Unfortunately, the terminology around personal data is used inconsistently, the concepts are unclear and there is a poor understanding of their relationships. This is a challenge to those who need to discuss personal data in precise terms, for example, legislators, academics and service providers who seek informed consent from their users. In this article, we present a lexicological analysis of the terms used to describe personal data, use this analysis to identify common concepts and propose a model of the digitally extended self that shows how these concepts of personal data fit together. We then validate the model against key publications and show in practice how it can be used to describe personal data in three scenarios. Our work shows that there is no clearly delineated kernel of personal data, but rather that there are layers of personal data, with different qualities, sources and claims of ownership, which extend out from the individual and form the digitally extended self.},

  abstract = {Computational methods, in particular text-as-data or Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches, have become popular to study climate change communication as a global and large-scale phenomenon. Scholars have discussed opportunities and challenges of these methods for climate change communication, with some proponents and critics taking strong positions, either embracing the potential of computational methods or critically questioning their value. Mirroring developments in the broader social scientific debate, we aim to bring both sides together by proposing a reflexive, integrative approach for computational research on climate change communication: We reflect on strengths (e.g., making data big and small, nowcasting observations) and weaknesses (e.g., introducing empiricist epistemologies, ignoring biases) of computational approaches. Moreover, we also provide concrete and constructive guidance on when and how to integrate (or not integrate) these methods based on theoretical considerations. We thereby understand computational methods as part of an ever-increasing, diverse toolbox for analyzing climate change communication.

SNA diagrams convey the dynamics of the transmission of disease and other complex networked relationships. We discuss three key connection patterns of relevance to public health applications: degree centrality, Eigenvector centrality, and betweenness centrality. This is followed by an overview of existing literature on disease transmission patterns and SNA. Using Gephi, an open-source software package, simple and clear renderings of the three centrality patterns are illustrated. We then describe how technical communicators can appropriately emphasize key features using visual rhetoric, and discuss the need to be mindful of how any graphics producing technology has its own built-in biases that may have rhetorical effects.},
